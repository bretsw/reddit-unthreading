We had a committee that came with a course release.  A number of members stepped down.  The chair asked for applications, but nobody applied because they didn't want to work with the committee chair, who can be autocratic and has a singular vision for running the program the committee is in charge of.  The head of the committee, ""Dr. X"" asked me to apply and I said I was too busy with another big assignment, which is largely true, but also because I have been talking to this person about  pedagogy, and we are just on opposite ends of the spectrum in our approach.  In addition, the committee was staffed entirely with members from a discipline not immediately associated with purpose of the committee.  We have a bifurcated department. Membership comes with a course release.  Dr. X created a lot of friction with the dean and asked for and received a decent stipend on top of two course releases.

So the chair dissolved the committee entirely and asked for applicants.

Eight people applied.

One of the original departing members changed their early retirement plans and rejoined the committee.  After much trepidation I applied, and after being accepted I thought about it for two days and finally accepted.

So Dr. X, who I will try to avoid armchair analyzing is going to be furious about this for a long time.  Their office is next to mine.  Yesterday I went to go fill my water bottle and Dr. X, unmasked, was coming down the hallway.  Dr. X's face was reddening and contorting.  Dr. X grunted in response to my greeting.

I could go on about Dr. X.  Dr. X complained angrily about having been rotated off as head of this committee 10+ years ago, and how it damaged his career.  Dr. X has been applying for jobs for years, trying to get out of this job and this state.

It's a good thing we are teaching online in the Fall, because future encounters with Dr. X fill me with dread and anxiety.  Had I applied for the position when he asked, he would still be in charge of the committee, but I would be relatively miserable.

hkhwf7,2020-07-03T08:06:24Z,NA,Professors,"I'm a NTTF in the humanities, starting my 5th year as faculty, was a grad instructor here for 6 years prior. I teach intro courses on race, sex, ethnicity, and gender to about 125-140 students each semester (4/4). I deal with lots of plagiarism, lots of abuse and nastiness from students who haven't turned in any work, lots of essays filled with ""I didn't read the assignment, but I've got lots of uninformed opinions about a question you never asked."" I am also very frightened by some of my more aggressive and confrontational students who include racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, or misogynistic intimidation or ""trolling"" comments in their submitted work. The university has said this is the student's right to free speech and is really open to interpretation. At my performance review last fall, my director/chair told me I have to ""make sure every student has a happy experience.""

This forum has helped me see that many others have dealt with similar frustrations, but my well is drying up.  I'm exhausted all the time, I'm not as productive as I usually am. I have students who tell me I am a great professor, I have some students who are doing incredible scholarship and research. I wish I could focus on these students and their experiences. Yet I don't. I am absolutely horrified by comments in evaluations about ""she totally disrespected me by suggesting I  should  go to the Writing Center"" or ""She kept using the word ""indigenous"" and I don't know that word means.

I deal with lots of plagiarism, lots of abuse and nastiness from students who haven&amp;#39;t turned in any work, lots of essays filled with &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t read the assignment, but I&amp;#39;ve got lots of uninformed opinions about a question you never asked.&amp;quot; I am also very frightened by some of my more aggressive and confrontational students who include racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, or misogynistic intimidation or &amp;quot;trolling&amp;quot; comments in their submitted work. The university has said this is the student&amp;#39;s right to free speech and is really open to interpretation. At my performance review last fall, my director/chair told me I have to &amp;quot;make sure every student has a happy experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of teachers and professors I know are struggling with online teaching right now, with their main complaints being that students are not paying attention or not engaging fully with the class material.

One possible solution to these issues might be to enhance the teacher's overall online presence and OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) seems to be a great tool for that.

Since I am fairly new to OBS myself, there might be inefficient suggestions in the guide or a better way to do something; if you spot an error, please let me know so I can revise it!

hj5vxl,2020-07-01T03:48:19Z,NA,Professors,"My main textbooks are produced by the intergalactic edu-conglomerate known as Cengage. Back in the early '10s, Cengage used to send me nice, normal, paperback versions of each new edition of the textbooks I teach from. They were lightweight. They were bound. They didn't require wifi. 

Now, Cengage *maybe* sends me the shrink-wrapped loose-leaf edition, if I ask nicely. BYOB. (Bring Your Own Binder.) They really want me -- the instructor who chose their book over the other expensive, overrated books -- to use the free-to-them eBook instead. But they don't make it easy. They don't even make it kind of easy.

I'm pretty good with tech stuff. I taught myself Camtasia last week. I'm never the one holding up training sessions to ask the facilitator what a browser is. My school actually invited me to be one of the people who helped others get their courses online in March (at a respectable hourly rate), so people who know me evidently agree that I Can Computer. But Cengage eBooks? Fuck if I know. 

Their website is an actual labyrinth. You *might* find your textbook on there, but definitely not because you searched for the title of the book. It's more of a wacky shell game. ""We noticed you searched for the History of Narnia, 12th edition. Well, here's the 8th edition of Mordor Calculus, En Español. Mission accomplished. Byeeeee."" [browser crashes]

Nowhere on or near that book's page, or your account page, is anything resembling a link to read the eBook. They'll happily redirect you to demos of their latest ripoff-ware or statements about how they are Definitely Against COVID-19 and Do Not Support It. But a page that's like, here, just log in and we'll let you read this book? LOL nah.

FAQs? Oh, my heavens, the FAQs. They appear to be written by my students who have not done the reading and just make things up as they go.

Q: ""How Do I Access the eBook?"" 

*A: Log in to Cengage's website and click ""read the eBook"" if you can find it. LOL IDK this wasn't on the review u gave us* 

There's an app. I've downloaded it probably 26 times in 5 years. It's always different. The only consistent feature is that it looks and feels about 15 years old and designed with MS Paint. It never keeps me logged in. It forgets I'm an instructor. It accuses me of lying about being an instructor. It auto-expires my textbooks based on an algorithm of when I'm most likely to need access to them, even though I assign the same books every spring, summer, and fall. 

It makes me beg. It makes me, an Xennial, wait for business hours so I can beg my rep over the *telephone* (ew.) because it's only the year 2020 and nothing should be easy, especially not with a company that bills itself as a leader in digital education solutions. This company sends me (tacky, non-accessibility-compliant) emails all the time about how I should rilly rilly use MindTap. Sweetie, you can't even get me consistent access to the pages of this book, but you want me to entrust 100 students to you and your foolish test banks that appear to be written by anti-learning AI? 

I have considered OER, and I built one for my other-other class, and it took a long time and there are some textbook vs. OER complications with my school that would doxx me even more than I've probably done already, so just trust me that OER is off the table for now. I have to use Cengage. I can't even adopt a new book now, although I have a feeling Pearson is just the Kang to Cengage's Kodos anyway.

It's 2:30 AM and I just want to know what page to split Chapter 30 on for my syllabus, and that loose-leaf crapsicle they begrudgingly sent me is in a self-funded binder in my office, the office I last left in March, naively thinking I'd be back after Spring Break.

hizv75,2020-06-30T20:32:04Z,NA,Professors,"Hello! I'm starting on July 1st as an Assistant Prof at a large university, in engineering. I'm a young woman, and I was hired right out of graduate school - in fact, I got two tenure-track offers, from the only two applications I submitted. I am not saying this to brag, but rather to set the stage, that I seemed to be in demand when I was applying. Which you would think would make me confident in my abilities and in what my references think of me. But, I'm feeling the opposite.

The closer I get to starting, the more I remember previous stupid things I have said and done, and worry that many people will assume that I only got the job because I am a young woman. To make things worse, I just got a very grueling response on a major paper from my PhD, that makes me feel even more like a fraud. Yes, I know this is all part and parcel with academia, but ouch, it hits hard!

I'm also scared because my main advisor encouraged me to apply for postdocs, rather than faculty positions, and it was mentors outside of my graduate research group who pushed me to pursue Assistant Prof positions directly.  I managed to draw up a memory of a very fundamental mistake I made in a group meeting just over a year ago, and am wondering if my advisor just didn't think I was good enough.

I feel like being in this new position, particularly as a young woman obtaining a tenure-track job so quickly, that I'm under extra scrutiny from my colleagues, and from my friends. Unfortunately this fear has been confirmed by the number of people who feel the need to make snarky comments about my success - including ""professors don't really need to be great scientists"" and ""someone must have pulled strings for you.""

My question is - did anyone else feel this way stepping into their new positions? Is there any advice on how to survive and persist? I'm afraid that if I reach out to too many of my mentors about my crippling insecurity, they will start to only see me that way.

I know imposters syndrome is a real thing - but maybe this is the case where I AM the fraud?!

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also scared because my main advisor encouraged me to apply for postdocs, rather than faculty positions, and it was mentors outside of my graduate research group who pushed me to pursue Assistant Prof positions directly.  I managed to draw up a memory of a very fundamental mistake I made in a group meeting just over a year ago, and am wondering if my advisor just didn&amp;#39;t think I was good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like being in this new position, particularly as a young woman obtaining a tenure-track job so quickly, that I&amp;#39;m under extra scrutiny from my colleagues, and from my friends. Unfortunately this fear has been confirmed by the number of people who feel the need to make snarky comments about my success - including &amp;quot;professors don&amp;#39;t really need to be great scientists&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;someone must have pulled strings for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is - did anyone else feel this way stepping into their new positions? Is there any advice on how to survive and persist? I&amp;#39;m afraid that if I reach out to too many of my mentors about my crippling insecurity, they will start to only see me that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know imposters syndrome is a real thing - but maybe this is the case where I AM the fraud?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: New assistant prof starting in a few days, insecurity and anxiety growing exponentially. What are other people&amp;#39;s experiences with this? How did you cope?&lt;/p&gt;

higw6m,2020-06-30T01:15:05Z,NA,Professors,"New here, but I have already been enlightened by many of the discussions. Wish I had found this group long ago!

I'm sure this has been asked, but I'm hoping someone can help me with a succinct list of steps/recommendations for hybrid/online teaching for the fall. My university just throws random emails at us with links to pages that have even more links and then more random emails with rules we have to follow, and then more emails with more rules. Needless to say, it's overwhelming and doesn't feel very organized. 

What I'm looking for specifically is how to handle hybrid/online teaching for a monster lecture class (200 students). I don't really want to spend a lot more time testing out different software and formats. I just want someone's advice who's been there, done that, and has a reasonable model that they've had some success with. Just a PDF with bullet points is fine, or a fairly brief video or PowerPoint presentation. I just can't afford to go down any more rabbit holes trying to reinvent the wheel when I know there is something out there already that can be used as a kind of template. I have basic ideas of how I want to do it, but I'd like to see how others have done it to modify what I'm already doing.

FWIW, I teach an undergraduate science class aimed at non-science majors, so the vast majority of students don't want to be in the class--they have to take it to graduate. Even with f2f classes, participation is minimal at best. Right now, we can't have more than 50% of the class in the classroom at any given time, and we have to have assignment seats to help with contact tracing for when (not if) we get a COVID-positive student. Oh, and we have to ensure a 6-foot radius around each student. Note: I have no TA to assist with attendance or any of this planning, so I'm not sure how I'm going to manage this on top of all these other new responsibilities. 

In the spring, I ended up recording lectures (via PowerPoint recording feature) and posting them on an unlisted YouTube page so only students with the link could access them; I taught asynchronously. I broke the lectures into 10-15 minute chunks, depending on topic. I decided on YouTube because of the auto-generated closed captioning. (Now I'm learning this isn't ""good enough"" to meet ADA requirements, but I'm hoping if I correct errors in YouTube, it might fly.) I tried to offer optional Zoom sessions, but only a handful of the 200 students opted to participate, and then they just muted themselves anyway. 

I was already using Blackboard for messages and assignments, so that part of it remained basically the same. Instead of taking attendance, I asked questions about each lecture that the students had to answer in order to get attendance point credits. This seemed to work out reasonably well, even though I could track student participation through YouTube and see that most were just scanning through the lectures to get to the part where I answered the question--or they were just guessing the answer without even watching. But I thought it was a good strategy to get most of them to at least find and watch the most critical part of the day's lecture. So I'll count that as some small measure of success!

I've been looking through a few posts here that mention ""flipping"". I think I might try something like that, where I record lectures and have them answer questions directly over the lecture as homework (probably in addition to regular assignments). Then we can spend time in class working on the larger assignments instead of lecturing. This way, when (not if) we go to full online again, I won't have to change the basic set-up of the class. Just change the f2f part to a Zoom meeting. 

I teach MWF, so I plan to have 1/3 of the class present each day. I think I'll just do the same thing every day of the week so no one ""misses"" anything by not being present the other days. It seems like a good plan to go over the week's assignment and leave time for questions. 

Probably the biggest improvement I'd like to make is this: I'd like to see how feasible it is to integrate the lecture questions into the lecture video itself. I've taken numerous Coursera/EdX classes, and I feel like the integrated questions really help reinforce the information and force students to take a needed pause during the lecture. (I do this normally in lecture, where I put in slides with questions and ""make"" the students say the answer aloud.)

hi6bp2,2020-06-29T15:06:23Z,NA,Professors,"As a professor looking back on my undergrad and grad career, my most bizarre college experience was an issue I had with a professor, we'll call him Dr. Retired for confidential purposes, neglecting to view over an application I had submitted for acceptance into the program. It was two weeks before classes were to begin, and obviously, the courses were full by that time. I wanted a yes or no response- just confirmation because I knew it would be difficult to get into any course. Because the professor wasn't responding to me, I emailed the department head. I don't remember saying anything mean, just specifying the time I had submitted my application for reference, quite a few months in advance, and if I could be given a response before classes began. I didn't find this to be unreasonable- is it?  I never contacted anyone else but the professor's superior.

The department head apologized, rectified the situation, admitted me, and immediately after, I received a scathing email CC'd to every person in that department, from Dr. Retired, renouncing me as an evil liar. I had never felt so humiliated, embarrassed, or upset. I found that to be highly inappropriate since the matter was between me, Dr. Retired, and the department head. I never talked about this person behind their back, and yet this person decided to portray me in a poor light to everyone. I'm not sure if the sole purpose was to ensure my failure or not allow me admittance to already full courses.

I don't remember too much about the particulars, but I know one professor emailed everyone back and mentioned how inappropriate Dr. Retired's response was. I don't think anyone else responded back. There was a possibility that one agreed with Dr. Retired. But I vaguely remember only receiving two emails from different professors.

Looking back as a professor myself, I still find this to be inappropriate and cannot understand what elicited such a spiteful response. Fortunately, I don't think anyone took the professor's comments at face value, because I did well. That professor was relieved of their duties, which were handed over to another professor, and then retired the same year. I have no clue if there were other issues going on with that professor, but I can't believe that my problem was related it to- so there must have been more to the story.

In effect I believe this student was lazy and did not want to answer the questions, so instead researched sources, then copy/pasted from one that best fit, with some minor word massaging here and there.

I've reported this to them as an academic honesty violation on the grounds that they were passing off other's work as their own, but they are appealing it and saying they didn't understand they couldn't cite like this (this student has two semesters left before graduation, and said that they are doing well in their other courses as evidence that he is not cheating).

I'm currently working at a national lab, and it is a disaster. On top of the absurd, insane government bloat and bureaucracy making it nearly impossible to get anything done, my lab has been SHUT DOWN for almost a year now due to a radiation leak from the failing infrastructure. If it sounds like an nightmare, it certainly was. It's left me with some real hangups in regards to lab work, I really don't feel safe here. To give you an idea of the dysfunction of the lab, it took me about 5 months to get a 1ml vial of PURE WATER stable isotope standard from USGS because of all the paperwork and the LEGAL TEAM having to be involved with the purchase.

I still managed to be minorly productive this year and am a co-author on a few publications, but I do feel like I was robbed of a very important year of work. 

I have been applying to jobs for the past year, ever since the leak was detected, and on top of the fact that there is MAYBE 1 job a month nation wide that fits in anywhere close with my expertise, I have applied to all of them and have not gotten a single offer. I sent my generic resume and cover letter to my old masters and phd advisor who both said it looks good, and also reached out to a few people in industry to see if i was missing some key aspect of perhaps addressing the specific job listing or something of that type when I make unique resumes and cover letters for the different positions.

I can barely afford to pay my loans, rent, and eat. 

My family are russian immigrants, mostly uneducated, and my whole life I was told that education was my ticket to a stable, secure, job and a middle-class life. I think they just did not know any better, but I don't know what to say of my academic advisers, who never in any way prepared me for a job market that is uninterested in my skills. I feel like I sacrificed my 20s making $20k/year for nothing. I could have stopped at a bachelors and made $50k/year just working for an engineering firm. No I can't even get that job.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/los-angeles-rules-tv-film-production-restart-1234631823/""&gt;https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/los-angeles-rules-tv-film-production-restart-1234631823/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know acting is not the same as being a professor, but I think it is important to point out that an industry with a strong union is telling member to not sign Covid waivers.&lt;/p&gt;

hgeti1,2020-06-26T16:00:16Z,NA,Professors,"I've seen a lot of discussion here and on social media where professors are lamenting that their administrations are making the wrong choices for the Fall and are ignoring faculty input. This is the current situation at my college, where the admin is dictating to us that our classes must be in person to justify bringing back students and their housing $$$. But my department has gotten together and unanimously decided that faculty need choices and decision-making authority about how to best run their classes for safety and pedagogical reasons and it's gaining a lot of momentum among other departments. Remember that collectively we have power. If you have a union, use it. If you don't, it doesn't matter, if you speak as a unit you have power. Individually we have weaknesses like being contingent faculty or pre-tenure. As a group we are all the college has. If we don't teach our classes there is no school. If you haven't started organizing on this do it NOW. The earlier this is settled the better it is for you and your college.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're trying to make an argument for pedagogy, keep in mind the restrictions that your state will probably put on your school. 6ft of social distancing and masks? That is not conducive to peer work, foreign language learning, or generally easy communication in the classroom.

This is the current situation at my college, where the admin is dictating to us that our classes must be in person to justify bringing back students and their housing $$$. But my department has gotten together and unanimously decided that faculty need choices and decision-making authority about how to best run their classes for safety and pedagogical reasons and it&amp;#39;s gaining a lot of momentum among other departments. Remember that collectively we have power. If you have a union, use it. If you don&amp;#39;t, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter, if you speak as a unit you have power. Individually we have weaknesses like being contingent faculty or pre-tenure. As a group we are all the college has. If we don&amp;#39;t teach our classes there is no school. If you haven&amp;#39;t started organizing on this do it NOW. The earlier this is settled the better it is for you and your college.&lt;/p&gt;

I have my students use a simulator website for their labs and then I assign a separate write-up that they hand in on the LMS.

Now what I’m struggling with here is the students that turn in their write-up late. I had about 25 students not meet the deadline last time; some of them were 10 minutes late and some were a full week late. Where do I draw the line?

If I fail the people handing it in 6 days late then it looks unfair that the people handing it in 5 days late get a pass and so on until I pass everyone.

My syllabus does state that “A late lab report is equivalent to no lab report”, so I could just fail all of them, but I’d feel terrible about someone failing for such a small mistake and I’d get a lot of backlash.

hftfvl,2020-06-25T16:24:50Z,NA,Professors,"Last semester I was teaching two classes online for the first time. The quick transition to online only was rough, and I decided that to make it a bit easier on myself, for one class I would create my own videos from scratch based on the lecture notes that I would have used. For the other class, I was able to find some good quality open source videos which were captioned.

Well in one class, my evaluations say that I'm lazy for not holding Zoom sessions and instead just posting videos. In my other class, my students are upset that they were given ""old"" math videos to watch (Calculus hasn't changed much in the last 10 years, so no need to re-invent the wheel).

For a variety of reasons, I chose not to hold regular Zoom meetings. (My husband I and I share bandwidth and he also frequently has conference calls for his work. Some students who signed up for a class in a certain time slot might no longer be available at that time due to work, childcare, Internet issues, etc.)

Then some of my co-workers who did hold live Zoom sessions would also record it so that students could view it later if they wanted or couldn't make the scheduled time anymore. Then students would stop showing up because they knew that it was going to be posted later anyways, so why not sleep in?

So, what should one do?

If you post old youtube videos, you are lazy for not making your own.

If you make and post your own videos, you are lazy for not doing your class as a live Zoom session.

If you do a live Zoom session, record it and post it, students will just opt to watch it later, or not at all.

I was able to get Physics 1 lab up and running online, no problem.  I have 16 experiments in an online format.  I'm using Vernier's sample data and write-ups.

My current plan is to use private channels for each group so that students don't have to ""remember their group number"", and then have 2-3 TA's assigned to each lab group (approximately 30 groups, probably 5-6 TAs). 

My main questions are:

1. Have any of you done something similar?

I use the term lab in a loose sense; students in small groups participate in active learning activities, with several TAs present to help answer questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current plan is to use private channels for each group so that students don&amp;#39;t have to &amp;quot;remember their group number&amp;quot;, and then have 2-3 TA&amp;#39;s assigned to each lab group (approximately 30 groups, probably 5-6 TAs). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

We have a number of classrooms with computers at all the desks for student work. During a meeting with our IT people, I asked what the plan is for sanitizing these classroom computers between classes, since there are a lot of classes scheduled in these rooms. I was told that the university can't possibly sanitize between classes so most likely they will put out sanitizer dispensers and have the students be responsible for cleaning the computers before use. I was really shocked - how well are students going to do this task?  

And then in a later conversation with a friend who is a parent of a college kid, she mentioned that they got an official email about plans for the fall which said that students, upon entering a classroom, would be able to take cleaning supplies and clean their own chair and desk. Professors would likewise sanitize the area where they are teaching.

So I guess universities are just giving up on the idea of providing safe classrooms? Not enough money, I guess. If I were a student, I would be opting for online classes only.

Hello all. I've got a student (we'll call him J) who just emailed me asking if I'd be willing to see his sales pitch for Cutco knives.

I've got a good relationship with J and helped him get an excellent campus job for this fall, but I know Cutco preys upon naive students like him and I'm not keen to promote the company's interests. I'm wondering how to kindly inform J about Cutco's scam while still supporting him and making this a teachable moment.

I did a little research and it looks like Cutco employees get paid for appointments aside from commission. Would it be best to let him know ahead of time that I'm agreeing to his pitch solely as a chance to give him feedback on his public speaking skills? At least then he'd get paid.

Or, should I kindly refuse to see his pitch altogether? I don't want to inadvertently encourage his continuing to work for Cutco.

What would you do? I've drafted the below email:

*Hi J! It’s great to hear from you. It’s exciting that you’ve been hired for a job—congrats!*

*I also feel obligated to share what I know about Cutco/Vector Marketing—that they’re known for predatory hiring practices (especially among students) and withholding compensation from their employees. This website looks a bit odd, but you can corroborate its info elsewhere online:* [*https://gighustlers.com/is-cutco-knives-a-scam*](https://gighustlers.com/is-cutco-knives-a-scam)

*Or, perhaps you already know all this, and are proceeding with caution.*

*I’m in full support of your career goals and development, but I’m not in support of Cutco. I’d be open to hearing your pitch as long as it’s understood that*

* *I’m hearing your pitch for the purpose of offering you sales/public speaking skills feedback*
* *I won’t purchase any products*

EDIT: UPDATE:

Thanks for all the helpful comments!  

I reported the situation to the department of grad studies.  They have agreed to let me drop her as a student, and started an informal process to investigate the academic misconduct.  Because she was already enrolled at the school and this was her first academic offence it is unlikely that a formal process would result in expulsion.  Accordingly, the student has the option of searching for a new supervisor at my university.  It has been made clear that if she does this, a formal hearing will occur, and record of academic misconduct will likely be listed on her transcripts permanently. This may also make it impossible for her to find a new supervisor. The admins are pushing for an informal solution where she withdraws her enrollment.

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the helpful comments!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reported the situation to the department of grad studies.  They have agreed to let me drop her as a student, and started an informal process to investigate the academic misconduct.  Because she was already enrolled at the school and this was her first academic offence it is unlikely that a formal process would result in expulsion.  Accordingly, the student has the option of searching for a new supervisor at my university.  It has been made clear that if she does this, a formal hearing will occur, and record of academic misconduct will likely be listed on her transcripts permanently. This may also make it impossible for her to find a new supervisor. The admins are pushing for an informal solution where she withdraws her enrollment. I am hoping for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

hd7qaj,2020-06-21T10:23:00Z,NA,Professors,"Long post here, with an email I sent trying to help a student understand.  My spouse thinks I've set myself up for trouble.  In this case I would welcome a grade dispute if this student is not happy.  

Context:

One week left in our first summer session.  I get an email from a student requesting I drop the lowest quiz grade (to offset a bad day) and offer extra credit for the term (because physics is hard).  My syllabus explains that I average quiz grades, then replace the lowest score with that average.  This new set is what I use when determining grades.  One bad day won't tank your grade, but all of your efforts count.  I also have what is a fairly standard physics grade breakdown.  Most physics instructors I've worked with are used to the notion that 60-65% is about what you can reasonably expect a student to ""get"" in any given term.  So, many of us put the C around 60-65% and a B around 70-75%.

My answer to both requests is no.  Please see the syllabus and our first  lecture \[this is recorded because we are entirely online\] regarding how I deal with ""bad days"" and quizzes.   Also,  please see the grade breakdown in the syllabus to understand why extra  credit is not offered.  I think you, as a student, deserve to know where I stand as a faculty member.  
 

The content of your email surprised me, especially your statement that  ""any type of help is appreciated.""  In our second 1-on-1 conference on \[date of conference\] you expressed concern about not being sure what to expect on the  quizzes.  I offered the opportunity to meet and discuss this when we had more time, and you dismissed that offer.   You didn't even acknowledge that it had been made.   You moved right on to questions from the third reading for that week.  \[This interaction is also recorded.\]  Based on this I  believe I can reasonably conclude the help that would be appreciated is a boost to your grade with minimal effort on  your part.  
 

I believe you did not mean to come off as disrespectful, and the tone was not that at all.  However, your requests for modifying how scores  are calculated and offering some way to raise a grade are very  disrespectful.  Either you made them without checking the syllabus (not utilizing the resources that have been given to you),  or you did check the syllabus and decided that I am not entirely capable  of making proper decisions about how to run and organize my classes  (assuming you know how to handle a college physics class better than I do).  The entire course I have stressed the  importance of separating yourself from your grade and focusing on  developing understanding and critical thinking.  Your message indicates  that you have largely ignored this general education aspect of the course.  Again, this suggests that in spite of my education,  experience, and expertise you feel you know better.  That may not have  been your intent, and you may say I am reading things all wrong, but  that is the message a request like this sends.

  
 I know many students now have the attitude that it can't hurt to ask and  ""you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.""  The latter could be true,  but sometimes when you take a shot it rebounds off the rim in a wild  direction, potentially causing harm.  I've broken fingers and bloodied my nose more than once rebounding bad shots,  both my own and from others.  Are students prepared for the outcome of  harm to reputation by ""taking a shot""?  I urge you to be more thoughtful  if you approach faculty in the future regarding the structure or content of a course.  Make sure you have read the  materials given to you before you ask for extra credit or modifications  to the grading scheme.  If, after reading the syllabus, you feel  something is confusing or potentially unjust, approach the professor from that direction.  At the very least it demonstrates  that you have read the syllabus.  
    
You say you would like to go to graduate school.  Requests for extra  credit and changes to the grading scheme will make it very difficult to  find a research adviser, or even be taken seriously as a member of the  department.  They tend to come off as you feeling entitled to a certain outcome, and that isn't the way things work.  It  only takes one fouled interaction with the wrong professor to make  graduate studies much more difficult.  
 

If you'd like to discuss this more, I'm happy to set a meeting or respond to an email.

My spouse thinks I&amp;#39;ve set myself up for trouble.  In this case I would welcome a grade dispute if this student is not happy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One week left in our first summer session.  I get an email from a student requesting I drop the lowest quiz grade (to offset a bad day) and offer extra credit for the term (because physics is hard).  My syllabus explains that I average quiz grades, then replace the lowest score with that average.  This new set is what I use when determining grades.  One bad day won&amp;#39;t tank your grade, but all of your efforts count.  I also have what is a fairly standard physics grade breakdown.  Most physics instructors I&amp;#39;ve worked with are used to the notion that 60-65% is about what you can reasonably expect a student to &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; in any given term.  So, many of us put the C around 60-65% and a B around 70-75%.  As one colleague put it in a department meeting &amp;quot;An A should mean something - consistent and sustained excellent work all semester - the A cutoff should stay at 90%.&amp;quot;  Society says a B is decent work, and a C is just scraping by.  This scale is a curve based on long-term observations rather than a single class&amp;#39;s performance.  A large part of the grade this term (30%, or half way to a C) is associated with 1-on-1 discussions.  There are 3 of them through the semester, 7-10 minutes each, for each of 40 students.

Edit:  [I can just record my screen and cursor using OSX directly.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721) ARghhh.

&amp;#x200B;

So my goal was to open up an assignment on Canvas, edit it while talking about it, and record the whole thing as a 15 minute lecture \[looks at clock\] I've been working on this for four hours, off and an.  I'm not a complete idiot.  I've been using computers for thirty years.  I'm on a brand new Imac.  Problems include:

* Video audio lag. I finally fixed this by choosing a specific .264 encoding setting (low cpu something, big file size).  I didn't notice the lag until I decided to get all fancy and put my dorky little face in the corner of the screen using the web cam.
* No cursor.  Because of the limitations of OSX the cursor doesn't show up.   There is a way to fix this.  It is not intuitive and I'm starting to not care.

Looking at my test files, I guess I've actually been working on this directly for about 2.5 hours, which is approaching ridiculous but not quite.

My goal is to just explain an assignment and emphasize a few key points.  It would probably have been faster to just revise and annotate the existing assignment, but I feel like I'm not doing much synchronous/video teaching and want the course to be more personal.  Oh, and also I'm sort of the department tech faculty, so I'm supposed to know this crap.

Should I be using a different app for this?

Should I care less about making videos?

Should I record myself at a whiteboard with a knockoff GoPro instead?

For the fall, most of my work is likely to be in-person tutoring of business students and in-person academic coaching of young undergrads.

&amp;#x200B;

I am teaching a class that I have taught 4 previous times, and helped create the content for in the most recent semester when we changed textbooks. Therefore, I know the content and I know all the assignments.

Last week, I was grading their first assignment which was a simple assignment of creating a (non-functioning) Java xml layout for an e-commerce app. The program did not need to function, just look good!

I open a particular student's submission and not only is it above the top amazing, it meets every single requirement for the **final assignment**. It has functions, it has parsing (saving things as byte data) it has responsive xml layouts based on device orientation.

&amp;#x200B;

It covers stuff we did not cover as of now, let alone the first two weeks. Either this student is a Java savant, mildly psychic, or...they asked a former student for the assignment.

The thing about the latter possibility is...THEY PLAGIARISED THE WRONG BLOODY ASSIGNMENT.

I am a tenured associate professor, and I am entering the stage of my life where family seems to matter more and more as I age. I have extended family about 2 hours away. Ideally, I would like to relocate closer to them so that my children can grow up around their cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. 

Do any of you think it is feasible to locate to that area or maybe somewhere in between? Here are some options I am considering: a) Commute to work one day per week and stack my teaching on that one day; b) Teach 100% online; c) Request to work at another campus branch in between (but still closer to the current location). 

a) This is a possibility since some of my colleagues do this. If this is the best option, I'm not sure if I should locate half-way in between family and work or skewed more toward family and face a longer commute. 

b) Seems ideal but unlikely, especially with the eventual push to return to face-to-face.

It seems impossible that we will get this money next year with budget cuts, so I want to make the most of it.  The money can be spent on anything related to professional development or teaching (no travel allowed for obvious reasons).  My courses will be online in the fall, and I'm also developing a course for future online delivery, so we're encouraged to buy things that will help with that.  Some things I've purchased already:

* A new, comfier desk chair
* Several books on college teaching (both for in-person and online instructional format)
* Latest APA manual
* Stylus for a virtual whiteboard (I already have a personal iPad)
* HD microphone (with pop filter) and HD webcam for recording lectures

I have over $1,000 left to spend in this year&amp;#39;s professional development funds.  It seems impossible that we will get this money next year with budget cuts, so I want to make the most of it.  The money can be spent on anything related to professional development or teaching (no travel allowed for obvious reasons).  My courses will be online in the fall, and I&amp;#39;m also developing a course for future online delivery, so we&amp;#39;re encouraged to buy things that will help with that.  Some things I&amp;#39;ve purchased already:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new, comfier desk chair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several books on college teaching (both for in-person and online instructional format)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latest APA manual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stylus for a virtual whiteboard (I already have a personal iPad)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HD microphone (with pop filter) and HD webcam for recording lectures&lt;/li&gt;

hb9z2m,2020-06-18T03:24:47Z,NA,Professors,"I know that, due to COVID, and all of the moves to teaching online in Spring, a lot of courses were not as rigorous as they would normally have been. Professors were frazzled and students were doing their best to adapt, so I am sure a lot of rigor fell by the wayside. Technology was iffy. Many students and professors didn't have the best computers or access to the Internet at home. We couldn't go to our campuses to use the scanner, printer, or library. We couldn't go to our offices, other than to grab a few books under the gaze of security. Most professors didn't enforce due dates, and I know many were unable to administer tests properly and gave up trying. A lot of students had not taken online courses before. Cheating became rampant, especially for professors who were accustomed to administering tests in person. Many of my colleagues were stunned at the amount of plagiarism they encountered, because they were used to giving in class essays. There weren't many tools for giving relatively cheat proof tests, and the testing centers were all closed. Many colleges had P/F options also. I am not sure how those are going to transfer down the road. I doubt a future medical school will accept a student who got a P in Biology. I wonder what long range implications that broken spring semester and weird summer adjustment will have. 

I am seeing students who are unable to write a coherent paragraph, but got all A's in the spring. I have one student who emails me every week wondering why they are doing so poorly. I am running out of things to say, because it's always the same thing. Most of it is an inability to follow basic instructions. I ask them specifically to answer 4 questions for an assignment, with certain criteria, and this person answers  1/4. I get almost incomprehensible answers with no punctuation or capitalization or even spacing between words. According to their transcript, their grades were terrible in the fall. But, sure enough, all A's in the spring, including their Comp class. Under normal circumstances, I am sure this student would not have gotten an A in their Comp class. No wonder they are puzzled by the grades they are getting now. I must seem like a dick. I have to imagine it's the worst for math professors who needed students to come in with prerequisites. 

I have taught online courses for a long time, and I am accustomed to giving detailed instructions and a lot of guidance that differs from my f2f students. But, there are so many students who have told me over the years that would not take an online course, because they know themselves. They need that face to face interaction with professors. They know they have to physically come to campus for so many hours a week in order to focus. If they sit through a lecture, they will absorb something. Now, they got thrown into a situation of responsibility and time management they know they aren't good with. Or, maybe the only time you can focus, where you don't have people at your house making a ton of noise, is when you are in class. If you post lectures online, in whatever format you choose, many of them just won't watch them. I can see the statistics of how much time students spend looking at the materials. Many of them are doing great. Others barely check in, and it shows in their grades. OF course, this is always true in online courses. But, it's different when you choose to take an online course.

And, there are many students who need accommodations that you just can't provide online with the services every college offers. I'm not sure how the disabilities offices will handle some of those things. How do you guarantee a quiet testing situation, when the testing centers are all closed,and their own home is chaos? Technically, if you put up recordings of your lectures, you either need to caption them with a script you read from, or use some sort of software that is laborious to go through and edit. That is very time consuming, especially if you are trying to pull 4 new courses out of your ass every week. Rather than do that, I know many professors either let YouTube do its best, put up PowerPoints with no narrations, or just tell students to read their book. Colleges need to spend money on better captioning software in general. It is out there.

I am not sure what we could have done any differently. We couldn't just have a do-over. And, a lot of students were actually doing fine, so it wouldn't have been fair to them. Administration was pressuring professors, in not so subtle ways, to let things slide. And, you could tell that students were parroting back very specific language that came from the college's administration and counselors. We were inundated with overwhelming amounts of information and change. And, I know professors had compassion for their students. I am not sure how we recover from this. If that math student got an A in Algebra, but they deserved a D, they are just going to have to take it again. Or, they are going to fail Calculus.

Our university structure is a little different in that each class is one month. Yup, a whole semester worth of work and information in a short 4 weeks. It's intense, but my classes are pretty solid and don't change much, often with only minor revisions based on industry and accreditation standards.

As with everyone else, the whole current situation thrusted us into the distance learning realm. It's been insane transitioning face-to-face classes to an online format. I am holding live lectures every day (roughly 4 hours a day) with recordings of them to review if they feel they need it. Since the transition, as with many of y'all, there are the complainers...they have outweighed the positives the past few months, they seem to have multiplied with the transition online. I know they didn't sign up for this...I didn't either. I try to engage with compassion and empathy, helping as much as I can, creating time management and study resources, and directing them to various services through our university based on their issues and/or concerns...it's been hell for most of us. 

I have felt defeated. I have cried. I've sworn...a lot. I should probably look into purchasing stock option with Yellow Tail Wine...because I have become a solid repeat customer.

&lt;p&gt;I have not answered, as I make it a policy not to respond when I am angry.  TBH, with this opening, I&amp;#39;m fairly certain that an equitable working relationship cannot be established.  If I had spoken to any of my faculty, Committee or lead investigators in this manner, I would have gotten my proverbial teeth knocked out of my head, and my mangled body would have been deposited in the walk-in cold room.  This may be a bit &amp;quot;old-school&amp;quot; on my part, but I do expect a modicum of respect when being approached for committee work.  Disagreement is fine, condescension is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a faculty bio that I can point them to, but I think I would prefer to diplomatically cut to the chase and send them elsewhere.  Any thoughts on a response?  Or am I overreacting?&lt;/p&gt;

It's scenic, charming, and has a good regional reputation, albeit scant name-recognition nationally. Since I got the job, back in 2015, I've been bothered by persistent hints of condescension or *noblesse oblige* on the part of R1 colleagues whenever my ""day job"" comes up.

&amp;nbsp;

 I'll give a lecture at an R1, for example, and colleagues there will refer to my heavier teaching load in horrified tones, saying things like, ""I just don't know how you can do it"" (with an expression that adds, *""I'd shoot myself if I had your life""*). Several times I've been asked, in a voice of abject disgust, if we teach 4/4 (we don't, actually, but could you please make a better effort to hide your pity? Most people, I find, don't like being pitied unless they're actively soliciting pity...). 

&amp;nbsp;

Other times, at group dinners with R1 colleagues, I've been singled out as the ""voice of the commoners,"" as if proximity to non-oligarch students makes me uniquely well-placed to speak ""authentically"" for the proletarians, the downtrodden, and the Benighted Ones. The exaggerated deference to my ""real life experience"" always makes me cringe, but it's hard to articulate why. (For one thing, in my experience, the gap in talent and intelligence between mid-tier SLAC students and Ivy students is far narrower than many would presume, so I feel defensive of my students...) 

&amp;nbsp;

Sometimes I'm asked when I'll be back on the job market--and not, evidently, because the one asking is planning to hire me, but because they simply can't imagine anyone *deliberately* choosing to teach at an LAC.

&amp;nbsp;

These colleagues never *intend* to sound pejorative or condescending, and oftentimes I think they assume that they're being kind by warmly ""sympathizing"" with my *presumed* hardships. The phrase ""microsnobberies"" comes to mind. Anyway, it always puts me on the defensive. I love my job, and I haven't been back on the job market since I found ""my place."" So the evident R1-prof perception that SLAC faculty are a subaltern academic class, feebly and ineffectually trying to claw their way out of the trenches-- well, it grates on me. 

&amp;nbsp;

So what's the point of this rant? For R1 profs reading this, I guess I'm gently asking you to be more attentive to these ""microsnobberies"" (if the shoe fits).

harb38,2020-06-17T09:39:38Z,NA,Professors,"Our school does some fully-dual enrollment hybrid sections to try to work around the schedules of local school districts. I've been doing it for a few years and have a colleague who was just asked to take on a DE history class. She asked me for advice and I think I want to make a list to add to our teaching resources because we are trying to expand our dual enrollment programming and I know I will get this question again as the one who has taught DE the longest. While I know we shouldn't change the content because the goal is for them to have the same experience, there are some considerations or things DE instructors should be aware of. I would love input based on your experiences.

Here's the list I have so far:

1. Most of them are used to teachers writing assignments on the board for them every day (and some even have parents managing their time for them) so making their own schedule isn't something that most of them are comfortable with yet. Expect some of them to struggle. There are a few good ways to address this.  
\- I go out of my way on the first day to talk about how it's different from HS and how I'm not going to remind them about every assignment and ""if it's on the syllabus, it's due."" I didn't do this early when I first started teaching DE and thought I would just hold firm and they would find their rhythm. That's true... they did, but after I started giving this speech on the first day of class, I feel like I had less issues because they knew that I wasn't going to write due dates on the board or send reminders. Or at least I didn't get any more ""you didn't remind us about this assignment in class so I didn't know it was due"" emails.  
\- Just overall be firm about deadlines early in the semester but also make early assignments hold less weight so while they are on a learning curve, if they can figure out a plan that works for them, they aren't sunk.
2. Be prepared for FERPA issues. Parents are used to being able to access their high schoolers' grades. I have asked our dual enrollment coordinator to send the FERPA release form to parents during the admissions process so they can ask questions if they want to but I don't know if he does or not. I have gone to a high school to teach a DE section a few times when they had the numbers and I always ask the guidance counselor I'm working with to send this to them in advance. But either way, I have a prewritten response ready because I typically get at least one parent emailing me about grades when I teach DE.
3. I make SURE I send an email a few weeks out with textbook info. Our admissions office sends a ""to do"" list with dual enrollment students that includes them obtaining a textbook but no-fail, I still have students absolutely shocked that we don't provide the textbook and it's a hot mess the first few weeks of school.
4. I include a ""Canvas Scavenger Hunt"" quiz for a few points that has them find information about our course that requires them to dig through our course because they aren't familiar with the LMS. (I actually started doing this with all of my gen ed classes because I have realized how little instruction our school gives our students in how to use it).

Anything else that's worked for you or that you would suggest new DE professors know?

&lt;li&gt;I know my voice gets muffled by masks, losing some consonants in particular. I&amp;#39;m planning on getting a headset style mic, but are there considerations I should pay attention to in selecting the mic in terms of how clearly it will pick up my voice from a mic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What specifically should I be paying attention to to ensure I get a mic that will integrate with my classroom set up? Most rooms on campus have speakers hardwired to a podium (housing DVD player, computer, etc).

My exams will be carefully timed, but open book/Excel.  I can not use a product like respondus monitor because the lockdown browser would prevent students from opening Excel.  

I would like to monitor the exams primarily to ensure the student enrolled in the course is the person taking the exam.  I have two ideas.  The first is to require students to log into Zoom.  Would then check their id and instruct them to leave the camera where I can monitor them taking the exam.  The second is to require the students record and upload time lapse videos of them taking them exam - again requiring them to start by showing their id.

The Zoom option is the best option to monitor because I will also be available for questions and can immediately address technology issues.  Also, I do not have to worry about privacy concerns once the exam is complete.  However, it will take a lot of time to set up and monitor 40+ students.  I will likely need to offer the exam at night when most if not all students can attend, and will need to set up extra time for students with disabilities.  It also could cause a bandwidth problem for students using a video zoom and taking the exam at the same time.

The time lapse video seems to be the best option for my time, but offers no real time monitoring possibilities.  In addition, I can foresee more technology issues (real and imagined).  I forgot to turn on my phone - I thought it was recording, I ran out of memory space, etc.  

Has anyone come up with a better solution?  Is there a shareable app for the time lapse option to make it easier for them to share their exam videos with me?

I was just informed that I will get a tenure track position at a different university than I'm currently working for as a post-doc. I am so excited, I can't really believe it yet.

Although it scares me a little because I feel nowhere near ready to actually be the responsible adult of a group and the courses I'll need to teach.. (although I've had my share of bad examples, so I kind of know what not to do?)

So how did you deal with this? And more importantly, what are the 'traps' to avoid?

EDIT: Hi again! thank you all for the advice! However it does make me wonder about the general environment in academia given how many people advice me to keep my head down in the beginning. 

Also, the mentor-finding is a great idea and I will get on it, same as finding out exactly how succes is defined in this new environment. I am getting more and more excited to start!

h95tyt,2020-06-14T21:02:36Z,NA,Professors,"The post about the supposed Berkeley prof who disagrees with BLM and a lot of what it implies got me thinking. Not about BLM (which wouldn’t be a good topic for this subreddit anyway) but about the diversity, or lack thereof, of viewpoints in college faculty departments. I’m also concerned, like the article’s author, about the impact on one’s career of disagreeing with what is often the extreme majority viewpoint.

I bring this up because, when colleges ostracize faculty (or students, or staff) for having views that don’t match the “popular” view, it greatly restricts the ability of the faculty to explore. If you believe that males and females have the same distribution of mental traits (for example), you’ll never consider a study that provides evidence that this isn’t the case. (FWIW, most neuroscientists believe that the average male and female brain differs, much in the same way that the average male and female height differs.) Or, if as the article’s author claims, you hold as an axiom that there’s institutional racism in the US, you’ll never consider any other explanation, even one that might have more supporting evidence, as an explanation for the fact that blacks in this country have a lower SES than whites.

Have others found that their departments are hostile to faculty with “different” views? I’m not talking about faculty who think slavery or the Holocaust never happened—you’re entitled to your opinions, but not your own facts. I’m talking about faculty who might be against *reparations* for slavery or the Holocaust, a topic which is certainly a reasonable topic for debate.

We have been encouraged to have conversations about the ongoing BLM protests with our class.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you feel that it is your responsibility to use instruction time to teach about racial themes or comment on current political events?&lt;/p&gt;

Biggest issue I had with async classes after our pivot was 50% viewing (compared to \~90% attendance before the pivot) so I'm looking for a way to boost engagement.

Our IT/learning center held a workshop for the H5P tool, which is integrated with our LMS (we use Moodle).  It was presented mainly as a way to create interactive videos, but there were many other functions as well.  According to the person running the workshop, only two faculty on our campus have used it, but have had success and positive feedback--I worry though that that's not a good enough sample for me to invest a lot of time into a new tool.

I'm thinking if nothing else it's a good way to ensure ""attendance"" if we're remote again if I use these interactions as a sub for the participation grade, but I wanted to see if anyone else has had experience using it long-term.  In my experience, a fancy new tool works well at first but then compliance falls off.   I also wanted to see if anyone has used it for its functions outside of interactive videos, as we didn't go over those in our workshop.

h7w3jg,2020-06-12T19:49:20Z,NA,Professors,"Hi folks,  
I'm trying to decide how to deliver my fall environmental history course, which has 25 students and meets twice a week, 75 minutes each time. For the past 25 years, I've taught it with readings and brief quizzes (before class in Canvas, our LMS), then in class I do mini-lectures for 5-7 minutes, then brief activities (whiteboards, discussions, etc) , then mini-lectures, etc. Once a month we do a debate, hearing, field trip, or other activity for the full period.  


My university *really* wants us to do a ""HyFlex"" fall--half the students come to class each session, and the other half Zoom in, with each student coming in person once a week. The students in the classroom can still do their mini-discussions, and the Zoom students can use break-out rooms for the mini-discussions.  


We can also opt to do a hybrid or flipped model, with the former material I offered in lectures delivered  asynchronously online (I'd do mini introductory lectures, then put video clips and brief quizzes, along with the powerpoints in each module, rather than putting in a long recording of my lecture). And in the classrooms, half the students would come for discussions on one day and the other half on the alternate day. Nobody would need to Zoom in; the online asynchronous material would make up for the reduced time in person).  


So: which seems better for student learning? Which seems better for professor sanity?  


Pros of HyFlex:  
\-students get to see each other more, even if half the time it's on Zoom  
\-I don't need to invest a ton of time into the course this summer when I'm trying to finish a book, since I have all the material for each class already set up, after teaching it for decades  
\-the administration is happier, not that that matters a lot  


Cons of HyFlex:  
\-the Zoomed in students will, I assume, quickly become ZonedOut students. It seems really boring for them to try and follow along on the computer, and active participation will, I bet, really reduce. Remote synchronous education for half the class seems like a loss of opportunity for them--even if they prefer it to the alternative of working through stuff online  


Pros of Hybrid  
\-probably sounder pedagogically  
\-they can watch a ton of cool American Experience documentaries, which are much better than anything I can pull together  


Cons of Hybrid  
\-seems like a bucketload of work for me, with major reconceptualization of course material, since basically I only have one online lecture to teach the material I typically use 2 classes to cover  
\-students will probably be frustrated, because they have too much computer stuff to do, and this would add more of it  


So: how to proceed? Of course, coronavirus may toss all this to the winds, but my admin is absolutely convinced we're going to be in person, damn the torpedos, full speed ahead (and yes, I'm in a fairly high-risk category, but oh well).

Specifically, how to do you balance bringing in grad students, post-docs, or a technician to your lab?

My own observations of my mentors and personal experience says that personnel investment is the single most important and expensive thing I will do with my start-up, so I want to make sure I do it correctly. They'll be the people generating the data that my first grant submissions, and I'm very cognizant of that. I also don't want to build a small army, that is so over-saturated with people it prevents any of them from taking real ownership of their work (conferences, publications, etc.).

Background: I'll be in a School of Pharmacy at an R1 and can utilize individuals with experience (or a desire to gain experience) in computational biology, microbiology, pharmacology, or clinical pharmacy backgrounds. Meaning, though I have a variety of people I could theoretically pull from, I want to [ideally] build a team that can overlap in key areas but are able to specialize in a skill or two to be the ""experts"" in that.

h7n5e4,2020-06-12T11:47:11Z,NA,Professors,"Bear with me.  A friend passed along a Fox News story about a professor making a list of students with objectionable political views with plans to disseminate and drop any of those students who registered fro her class. I read it, and found the link to the Campus Reform [story](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=15013)  Granted, *definitely* a biased source, but they do at the least show the screen shots of the Twitter posts.  Unfortunately, this sounds like exactly the thing we say doesn't happen - castigating and punishing students for having the 'wrong' views.  Even more surprising to me is this is coming from a STEM professor. Yikes.

So I was curious if any of you had more information.  It appears all this happened in response to ... something, but no-one ver clarifies what that something was too.  One professor responded with ""I'll drop him too,"" but we never know who ""he"" is or what he said to start this.  That's some nice reporting eh?  Anyway, I'm trying to assuage my friend that we professors are not a bunch of self-righteous asshats lording our superior opinions over the plebes, but it would help to know what was going on there.

On those dark occasions, people here have been very encouraging and helpful, and I have genuinely taken some comments forward and tried to reframe my thinking.

So in the spirit of not being doom and gloomy, this post is to suggest you implement something I did a few years ago. A colleague recommended it, and I think it's great.

Its called the 'glad' folder, and that's what I've called it too, because it makes me glad I do this job. You sometimes get emails from students or colleagues that are super touching and just make you so happy you do this. You read them and get some nice fuzzies, respond graciously and then delete them.

NO. Save them in the glad folder. It rarely gets opened. Im not claiming mine is overflowing or anything, there's a handful in there. It's not used to fan your own flames, you don't show it to other people, you don't use it to justify an interaction that was poop. 

It's there as a reminder when you have those really horrible days. You wonder why you do this and you question if you are cut out for it. Then, at night after a glass of wine, you allow yourself to read through them. You are a good teacher, you are doing your best, you are reaching people.

Start your own glad folder. You are appreciated, but you can lose sight of it in the day to day. Be kind to yourself when you need to.

Yet, I still have a student who is threatening to escalate it up the food chain over losing 5 points for not responding to any classmates.

Understand that not only did I tell them to read the syllabus in my intro announcement, I also did it in the first video lecture, and also gave them an actual syllabus quiz because I am sick of writing emails that say 'it's in the syllabus"" so while this doesn't eliminate them, it at least motivates more students to read it.

However, this student is contesting that if reading the syllabus itself is not assigned for points, students aren't actually required to do it. That's a new one although she's not going to get anywhere with it.

The funny part is that I would have just let her do it late if she had actually asked. Worst case (and if she had read the syllabus) she would know that I have a 10% per day late policy so even without knowing that I would have let her do it late, if she had just done it when this barrage of emails started (a day late), instead of threatening to get me fired, she would have gotten most of the points for it and it would have taken her less time than arguing back and forth with me over it.

&lt;p&gt;However, this student is contesting that if reading the syllabus itself is not assigned for points, students aren&amp;#39;t actually required to do it. That&amp;#39;s a new one although she&amp;#39;s not going to get anywhere with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny part is that I would have just let her do it late if she had actually asked. Worst case (and if she had read the syllabus) she would know that I have a 10% per day late policy so even without knowing that I would have let her do it late, if she had just done it when this barrage of emails started (a day late), instead of threatening to get me fired, she would have gotten most of the points for it and it would have taken her less time than arguing back and forth with me over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generation &amp;quot;Karen &amp;#39;s children&amp;quot; have entered college, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: Before the &amp;quot;why do you use DBs anyway? They are the worst.&amp;quot; posts start. Yes, I don&amp;#39;t love discussion boards either but I had very little notice that this in-person class was being switched to asynchronous and this was definitely a &amp;quot;this is the best I could do with the time I had&amp;quot; type fix. Not my ideal method either.)&lt;/p&gt;

That's a good question. I guess my answer is that rubrics (especially if given to students before essays are due) help students improve their writing. They are pedagogically useful.

h0cohr,2020-06-10T10:57:56Z,NA,Professors,"Hello, I hope everyone is enjoying the summer!

Today I finally received the online student evaluation results , and I have a few questions I would like to seek advice from you.

Background: I'm a TT junior faculty in a STEM major. I teach two sessions of the same prep, a 200-level core major that is also open to non majors. It's a hard-core course with hands-on labs and well known for heavy, challenging workloads. This is not the first time for me to teach the course but it's first time for me to do the repeated session.

I personally take all evaluations with a grain of salt because in the past some of my students evaluation had been often on other non-professional aspects such as comments on ""cute/too young"" (I'm an asian female, not this is related, but I do have some accent) . 

I taught two sessions in the same approach with the same materials and assignments. The assessments are also the same standards and grade distributions are also similar after curve. I did notice morning session, despite class size is only half of afternoon session, is overally weaker than afternoon session, and thus I had gone extra miles for morning session, like hosting more Q&amp;A, etc.  

However, my student evaluation from morning is significantly lower:

1)a lot more students in the morning sessions blamed covid situations on me. Comments like ""my grade dropped a lot after we moved online"".. 

2)a lot more students in the morning sessions complained hw being too hard, or course load too heavy. 

3) more students in morning sessions complained me being unclear/strong accents, not being nice, tough grader, etc. 

I am puzzled by the results. Afternoon session evaluation scored 0.3 above average but morning session is 0.1 below average. Despite the average of two sessions is still above department average, I'm concerned with the deviation.  

(I am not aiming to have top teaching evaluation and I will not lower my standards for it. I'm aware of what challenging work means for my evaluation. I will be happy to just have teaching nothing below average and so I can focus on research) 

My university still requires the evaluation of this semester to be considered for tenure/promotion, and I'm a bit concerned with how to explain this under average class.

&lt;p&gt;(I am not aiming to have top teaching evaluation and I will not lower my standards for it. I&amp;#39;m aware of what challenging work means for my evaluation. I will be happy to just have teaching nothing below average and so I can focus on research) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My university still requires the evaluation of this semester to be considered for tenure/promotion, and I&amp;#39;m a bit concerned with how to explain this under average class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice is welcome. Thanks so much in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been reading posts about slides in this sub to begin with and have found one great piece of advice in a few threads: Slides can be a lecture outline or a study guide, but not both.  But I think a class like C++ or Java is unique enough that it could benefit from some bonus detail.

But then I started getting FlameMyProfessor (sorry, Rate) reviews saying ""Slides are useless - can't learn from them.""  Well, yeah.  You aren't supposed to be able to.  Come to class.

So I added examples.  The programming-specific part of this question comes from how an example in C++ can be pretty big, text-wise.  That led to people frantically typing and ignoring my talky part.  (Even though I provide all files before class.)  So I tried to pull the important part out of the example - just have the three or four lines that are the day's topic.  That just led to confusion as extrapolation is an ability apparently missing in students.  They couldn't understand the ""missing"" code before the example.

The student missed his first appointment with the dean. I also learned the chem professor had received the same excuses and pictures, but with different dates. 

In the meantime, I began grading another test that was sitting on my virtual desk for a while. The student submitted two files (the test was a one-file submission thing). The two files came from two different computers. I sent the info I gathered to my dean.

A few days later, I get a call. The name I found on the file belongs to someone living on the same street as the student. Also, this person had already completed my course a few semesters ago, but with another professor. 

The dean finally gets to meet with the student. Confronts him on the accident stuff. Apparently, he really looked like he got into an accident and his papers corresponded to what he had said to his chem teacher. Unfortunately, he pushed his luck too far by making his injury bigger than it really was and trying to get a delay for his final exam in my course. 

The dean brought up the other test in the conversation. The student swore he made the test himself, in his room, without any help, on one computer. The dean name dropped the info of his neighbor. The student double downed that his long time friend had nothing to do with it. He was still unable to explain how he submitted two files from two computers.

The dean met with me afterward. No makeup exam and I was free to send the student a report for his intellectual fraud. 

The student replied to me: I know it looks bad...but it's only now that my neighbor and I have realized we mixed our laptops. I've been working on this laptop all along!

So...your trying to tell me for a full two weeks, while you are deep into finals and papers submission  that you haven't realized you had the wrong computer ? HAHAHAHA. Do I look this gullible ?

gzfuud,2020-06-09T00:25:20Z,NA,Professors,"***EDIT**** To clarify, this is not asking people to quit STEM/Academy work (even just for a day), it's asking people of STEM and academia to see addressing institutional racism in their field as PART of their work. It's asking people to spend one day preparing to incorporate that work into their future projects. Consider it similar to a grant writing day: how do you propose to address racism in your own labs and/or through your research? What will your methods be? What scholars will you use to back you up? 

By getting as many people involved as possible on a weekday, the goal is to make other sectors of academia take notice- are academic adminstrators acting with bias? Is there inequity in the NSF program? What about admissions and academic appointments?

The implication obviously is that if you have experimental material that must be tended to or otherwise it's ruined, you do so. The goal is this is also NOT to take a day off or something. The point IS to take at least part of your one day to start the work of bringing STEM into society with today's specific focus being how can STEM/Academia can address problems of racial inequalities that have contributed to the murder of innocent people like Breonna Taylor, Maurice Gordon, Alvin Cole, and so many others. The point IS to take a second of self reflection to see if you are complicit in allowing racism to continue at your institution.  

People *are* working on the things commenters listed to bring STEM/Academia into the real world, but they're not always being listened to so today is to amplify their voices so that change can happen! 

So I guess what I'm saying is even if you don't take time out of your day to talk about/work towards solutions that address the barriers for black researchers, you could at least mention it.

Starting a TT gig starting this fall. Tendered my resignation in January at my (now) old institution but committed to finishing the semester and any summer teaching, but none of my planned summer sections made due to COVID cutbacks, meaning May 31 was my last official day of work.

Today I got an email from my old institution with a list of things I'm supposed to do before my last day of work, which of course already happened. I'm supposed to procure at least nine different signatures from various people to assert that I have no outstanding parking fines, no checked-out library books, etc. Because all of the signatures have to be on the same PDF file, I'll have to solicit signatures one at a time, a process that (given the administration's punctuality) will probably take at least a month, and only then sit for an exit interview.

The email specified that I need to do this to avoid delaying my final paycheck - a paycheck I received last month via direct deposit. I returned my rented technology and office key weeks ago and have no unsettled accounts with the institution of which I am aware. With the check already cashed, I now have no external motivation to jump through these bureaucratic hoops.

So, you read the question wrong, knew you didn't understand it, ""solved"" it based on that misunderstanding, and therefore... I should give you the mark?

That's not... That's not how that works. That's not how any of this works.

**Edit:** Several of you had good questions, so I looked over the test again for further context (it was from the Fall). It was a question that required constructing a Linux command, and the student swapped two chunks of the syntax. It's a common mistake, and one I'd walked the class through before.

I always encourage my students to talk to me or e-mail me if they think I marked something incorrectly, or if a question was ambiguous or poorly written and I didn't realize. It's certainly happened! In those cases, I've either removed the question entirely from marking, or turned it into a extra credit question.

In this case, this student was the only one to claim ambiguity on this question, and only did so *after* I released their grades tests and the answer key for studying.

I think I may have had this happen twice in my entire teaching career prior to the last month (although when I was a HS teacher, every single parent and most of the other teachers tried to sell their stuff but I see it much less in higher ed). I've had 6 requests in the last month from December or May grads. Some part of me appreciates their willingness to hustle even if they chose an avenue that's unlikely to be fruitful. Yet, I just can't support that. These businesses are exploitive and rarely profitable. These kids are most likely going to blow whatever money and savings they have and put themselves in debt. 

While I think it says a lot about our current state of economy that recent college grads are succumbing to MLMs because they are underemployed, it doesn't mean this is a smart avenue for them. These conversations are so incredibly uncomfortable for me because I genuinely wish I could help them. 

I mean, I guess in some cases, I could. It wouldn't kill me to buy a Mary Kay lipstick. But at the end of the day, is that really helping them? That student might have made maybe $2-$3 off of my lipstick (and probably less when you count that some of these businesses require them to purchase samples, catalogs, promotional materials, etc). It doesn't take much research to see that these businesses are rarely profitable and most people wind up badly in debt because of them. I feel like I'm enabling them by saying yes. I would much rather see them put their time into doing something that is going to build their resume like doing meaningful volunteer work that might give them new experiences to translate to a resume or even trying to start their *own* side business. So even in these instances where it probably wouldn't be a huge deal, I'm conflicted about saying yes. 

I get it... they are desperate. They are already swimming in student loan debt and the job market is a mess. It's hard to find jobs, especially now with so many businesses in a hiring freeze or struggling to stay afloat. It's a crappy time to graduate. They are hearing uplines BS them about how much money they make so I'm sure when you are swimming in student loans, underemployed, and see some of your classmates thriving, that sounds like a fantastic plan. I get it.  I'm sympathetic but it doesn't make it a good idea.

Just about any time I have a student who is selling their own work or starting their *own* business, I will absolutely support them in some way. I will donate to their kickstarter, buy their products, or share their business info unapologetically.  I will happily help them with networking or write references for them. But I can't justify supporting MLMs. And it's uncomfortable because these businesses teach them how to be pushy and ""not take no for an answer."" Had one straight up tell me how stupid I am that to say no because he's going to become a millionaire off of his Amway (it wasn't called ""Amway"" but it's one of their other names) while I'm still making 5-figures, working late nights, and chasing tenure. Sure that kid was an ass, but I don't think he even gets that. He's repeating back what he's been told to say and he thinks this is a brilliant idea right now so I'm sure that it feels so unsupportive because they don't get it that by saying no, I'm not choosing not to support *them*. I care about them and their future. I'm refusing to support an exploitive business that preys on people like them.

gy3hyi,2020-06-06T21:38:50Z,NA,Professors,"Has anyone here ever been part of the debacle of team teaching!? Worse, when it’s intentional and not because a prof went on leave unexpectedly. 

Long story, the short version is that there are an extra 7 weeks of teaching my school can get out of full timers. Naturally, most profs take the time when they are not teaching (during normal life) to research, develop, conference, whatever. So what our school has brilliantly done for the Fall, is we’re going to be rolling out team teaching in some courses. Basically, they want to maximize any 7 additional weeks they can get out of FTers. Yes, you read that right, so here’s the 14 week slate for lots of courses:

1. First 7 weeks: Prof 1 (likely a FTer)
2. Next 7 weeks: Prof 2 (likely peasant adjuncts like me)

Guess which half of the course has more marking and is during final exams!?

Luckily for me, I usually have a high course load per term (4 courses) and I’ve been given headsup only 2 courses will have to be team taught, so 2 I’ll have on my own. Also, I teach the hardest class in our major, so nobody wants to teach this class, hence the FTers didn’t select that one. I suspect some adjuncts will have no courses though, as they can just have 2 FT profs split a course. 

This must be what they mean when our Provost stated earlier this year we were going to have “innovative, forward thinking pedagogy” fit for “changing student needs”.

gxybxm,2020-06-06T16:22:26Z,NA,Professors,"Throwaway. I've cruised enough posts here to know that I don't need validation to leave academia, but I'm in a bad spot and would appreciate some perspective. Thinking through this alone isn't working, and I have no safe mentors to turn to. This is long and emotional, so read on only if it won't be a burden.  

&amp;#x200B;

**HISTORY:** English Lit BA in 2008, Fiction MFA in 2014. I adjuncted FYW classes, tutored at a CC writing center, and ran my own test prep business 2014-2018, while clawing my way to FT teaching work and making ends meet. In 2018 I landed a half teaching, half admin role at a writing center at a religious SLAC. I still adjunct on top since the salary is low.

**NOW:** I'm mentally and emotionally gutted after a lost job opportunity and two years (plus a hellish spring) at a dead-end, underpaid ""full-time"" admin/teaching role. I don't think there's any reason to stay, but I'm devastated, and maybe looking for permission to let go (as stupid as that is). 

&amp;#x200B;

This spring, I applied to an ideal lectureship position at a public university in my city (I had adjuncted for the university and per a colleague there, I had a good shot) but I didn't get an interview, and with COVID-19 they're not following through with hires anyway (they were aiming to hire several lecturers).  It hit me hard. I adore teaching at the college level--teaching and my quest for FT work have become much of my identity--and I've survived this long because every time I felt ready to break, a slightly better opportunity would come along and save me. Except for now. 

I took my current role as a temporary one to get the administrative experience needed for a FT teaching role. I'm not interested in WC work long-term and there is no growth for my position. It's also hurting me professionally--many menial administrative tasks keep me from focusing on teaching/professional development. Also, having to adjunct on top has made my workload unsustainable. My boss is kind, but has proven themselves not to be an ally; whenever I propose improvements to our WC processes or suggest I join committees/projects that would develop me, they pull out the now two-years-old job description for my role and remind me of the things I'm allowed do. The chair of the English department is enthusiastic about me--everyone is--and said they would hire me full-time if they could, but it's not within their power. *Also pertinent:* Most days I'm lonely, alienated, and scared since the more religious employees at the university ferret out anyone who isn't ""the right kind"" of religious, and I'm not. We've had several contentious firings based on sexuality, and 15-20 employees have left over the past 2 years because the university hasn't taken a strong stance against incidents of racial discrimination among faculty and staff. 

Thus, I never saw myself staying at this university for the long haul, even if I were able. I was hoping the lectureship would be my ticket out, and if that didn't work, I had planned to quit and keep adjuncting at my other institution while I built up a freelance copy editing business--but now it feels foolish to throw away a job in a pandemic. And still, I'm repelled by the idea of returning this fall. University leadership is proving itself wholly incompetent in terms of handling the pandemic safely. This spring was a nightmare, and fall looks to be the same. 

*But I think what's hurting most right now* is that the huge love I feel for teaching has slipped away. Usually my glowing student evaluations fill me with satisfaction, but when I looked at them this spring, I felt nothing. I felt no joy or triumph at surviving the semester, only dread and panic at having to do it all over again in two months. I fear there will be no end to this misery, that I am putting my vulnerable self out there to be hurt again and again. I want to believe that I am selfless and brave enough to follow my dreams and stay for my students, but I'm starting to see that I'm not, and it fills me alternately with shame and anger.

I have given so much of myself to this pursuit. I don't think there's been a week or weekend in the last 6 years where I haven't graded or turned down plans with friends to lesson plan. Recently my husband was mourning the fact that his parents couldn't come celebrate his birthday as planned because of the pandemic, and my reaction was relief because I would be free to work. I realized my reaction would be the same *even without the pandemic.* How fucked up is that? Amidst a global fucking pandemic, all I can think about is work. 

And even all my best hasn't been enough. Every time I stayed late to comfort a student through finding her sister's dead body or getting choked out by her boyfriend, every time I made a student realize they liked writing when they used to hate it, every time a student emailed me two years out from graduation to tell me how much they use writing in their job... none of it mattered. Nobody saw it. All of my grad school mentors who told me I have a gift for teaching matter for shit. I don't have a PhD and the magical combination of traits that makes me sexy and hireable. I know it's not my fault that the higher education job market has become so cut-throat, or that my field is so poorly regarded, or that I graduated into the 2008 recession, and that now there's a pandemic... but I really thought if I tried hard enough, I could make something work. 

Now all I want to do is get some dumb job I can do to make a lot of money and be selfish. I've never had so little mental energy to care about anything. I feel so ashamed to admit this, but I can't even stand reading my colleagues spirited posts about the recent police brutality and BLM protests. I care and am committed to anti-racist work, but to talk about it and care like they do feels both impossible and blasphemous right now. Aside from my therapist, I have nowhere to put these feelings. 

What was it all for? I'm 33 and have never had a full-time job that paid more than $40k. My savings and retirement are stunted due to years of graduate school, adjuncting, and low-paying work despite averaging $40-50k per year between several jobs since 2014. I'm stuck in what feels like a student apartment in my large city where my husband's lucrative job is, but even with the city's plethora of universities *there have literally been only 5 job openings I was qualified for* in the past 6 years. Now, the market can only get worse, right?

Why stay? What is there for me? When there was the promise of a better future and the daily joy of interacting with my students, that was enough, by a close margin. Now, I have neither, and I don't even know when I will again.

I'm heartbroken, but I also can't imagine continuing to... let myself hurt myself like this. I have an issue establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries in my life and this feels like another fucking manifestation of that inability. Maybe if I were stronger, I could survive this, but I feel worse than I have in a long time. 

I know many of you probably feel the same. I'm not unique in this suffering even if it feels that way, and many have it worse. Still, a (healthy, I think) part of me says this should be enough, that I'm allowed to want something better for myself, even if that means not helping others for a while so I can help myself and get stable.

I adore teaching at the college level--teaching and my quest for FT work have become much of my identity--and I&amp;#39;ve survived this long because every time I felt ready to break, a slightly better opportunity would come along and save me. Except for now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my current role as a temporary one to get the administrative experience needed for a FT teaching role. I&amp;#39;m not interested in WC work long-term and there is no growth for my position. It&amp;#39;s also hurting me professionally--many menial administrative tasks keep me from focusing on teaching/professional development. Also, having to adjunct on top has made my workload unsustainable. My boss is kind, but has proven themselves not to be an ally; whenever I propose improvements to our WC processes or suggest I join committees/projects that would develop me, they pull out the now two-years-old job description for my role and remind me of the things I&amp;#39;m allowed do. The chair of the English department is enthusiastic about me--everyone is--and said they would hire me full-time if they could, but it&amp;#39;s not within their power. &lt;em&gt;Also pertinent:&lt;/em&gt; Most days I&amp;#39;m lonely, alienated, and scared since the more religious employees at the university ferret out anyone who isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;the right kind&amp;quot; of religious, and I&amp;#39;m not. We&amp;#39;ve had several contentious firings based on sexuality, and 15-20 employees have left over the past 2 years because the university hasn&amp;#39;t taken a strong stance against incidents of racial discrimination among faculty and staff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I never saw myself staying at this university for the long haul, even if I were able. I was hoping the lectureship would be my ticket out, and if that didn&amp;#39;t work, I had planned to quit and keep adjuncting at my other institution while I built up a freelance copy editing business--but now it feels foolish to throw away a job in a pandemic. And still, I&amp;#39;m repelled by the idea of returning this fall. University leadership is proving itself wholly incompetent in terms of handling the pandemic safely. This spring was a nightmare, and fall looks to be the same. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But I think what&amp;#39;s hurting most right now&lt;/em&gt; is that the huge love I feel for teaching has slipped away. Usually my glowing student evaluations fill me with satisfaction, but when I looked at them this spring, I felt nothing. I felt no joy or triumph at surviving the semester, only dread and panic at having to do it all over again in two months. I fear there will be no end to this misery, that I am putting my vulnerable self out there to be hurt again and again. I want to believe that I am selfless and brave enough to follow my dreams and stay for my students, but I&amp;#39;m starting to see that I&amp;#39;m not, and it fills me alternately with shame and anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have given so much of myself to this pursuit. I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s been a week or weekend in the last 6 years where I haven&amp;#39;t graded or turned down plans with friends to lesson plan. Recently my husband was mourning the fact that his parents couldn&amp;#39;t come celebrate his birthday as planned because of the pandemic, and my reaction was relief because I would be free to work. I realized my reaction would be the same &lt;em&gt;even without the pandemic.&lt;/em&gt; How fucked up is that? Amidst a global fucking pandemic, all I can think about is work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even all my best hasn&amp;#39;t been enough. Every time I stayed late to comfort a student through finding her sister&amp;#39;s dead body or getting choked out by her boyfriend, every time I made a student realize they liked writing when they used to hate it, every time a student emailed me two years out from graduation to tell me how much they use writing in their job... none of it mattered. Nobody saw it. All of my grad school mentors who told me I have a gift for teaching matter for shit. I don&amp;#39;t have a PhD and the magical combination of traits that makes me sexy and hireable. I know it&amp;#39;s not my fault that the higher education job market has become so cut-throat, or that my field is so poorly regarded, or that I graduated into the 2008 recession, and that now there&amp;#39;s a pandemic... but I really thought if I tried hard enough, I could make something work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all I want to do is get some dumb job I can do to make a lot of money and be selfish. I&amp;#39;ve never had so little mental energy to care about anything. I feel so ashamed to admit this, but I can&amp;#39;t even stand reading my colleagues spirited posts about the recent police brutality and BLM protests. I care and am committed to anti-racist work, but to talk about it and care like they do feels both impossible and blasphemous right now. Aside from my therapist, I have nowhere to put these feelings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was it all for? I&amp;#39;m 33 and have never had a full-time job that paid more than $40k. My savings and retirement are stunted due to years of graduate school, adjuncting, and low-paying work despite averaging $40-50k per year between several jobs since 2014. I&amp;#39;m stuck in what feels like a student apartment in my large city where my husband&amp;#39;s lucrative job is, but even with the city&amp;#39;s plethora of universities &lt;em&gt;there have literally been only 5 job openings I was qualified for&lt;/em&gt; in the past 6 years. Now, the market can only get worse, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why stay? What is there for me? When there was the promise of a better future and the daily joy of interacting with my students, that was enough, by a close margin. Now, I have neither, and I don&amp;#39;t even know when I will again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m heartbroken, but I also can&amp;#39;t imagine continuing to... let myself hurt myself like this. I have an issue establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries in my life and this feels like another fucking manifestation of that inability. Maybe if I were stronger, I could survive this, but I feel worse than I have in a long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know many of you probably feel the same. I&amp;#39;m not unique in this suffering even if it feels that way, and many have it worse. Still, a (healthy, I think) part of me says this should be enough, that I&amp;#39;m allowed to want something better for myself, even if that means not helping others for a while so I can help myself and get stable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening.&lt;/p&gt;

So the very institutions whose job it is to take adolescents and young adults who are...

* not yet wise in the ways of the world,
* in many cases  sheltered and/or hopelessly provincial,
* probably a little bit rough  around the edges,
* naive AF, relatively speaking...

...and teach them; mold them; expose them to a constantly  shifting, ongoing, and vital dialogue of varying viewpoints; offer them an array of potential adult role models; and  broaden their horizons - the very things that ignorance *needs* to be countered with to open up closed eyes, small minds, and cold hearts... are saying ***no*** to them?

I'm sorry, I get the sentiment behind it, but that seems like a complete abdication of responsibility on the institutions' part.

Fine, private colleges and universities can pretty much do whatever the heck they want (though I still question whether they should). But I certainly hope that this is not happening at  public colleges and universities. Because the public includes everybody, even the assholes.

Is there something I'm missing? This does not seem like that complicated of an issue to me. Doctors do not get to pick  and choose the patients that they treat. The perp and the victim are  equal once they enter the ER. We treat, and treat with, with those who come through our doors.

gwf1je,2020-06-04T06:43:13Z,NA,Professors,"Hello, there!

I know some of us would rejoice never hearing the word ""grades"" in their lifetimes, so I'm sorry if this triggers some bad memories of checking papers and grade grubbing. :P

I don't know if it's just me, but I'm always so fascinated by the grading systems that other professors use in their classes. I know of one senior faculty who stipulates that an ""A"" is at least 90% of the highest score in that specific class, ""B"" is 80%, and so on. He told us about a semester where the highest score was 40/100 and that about half of the class got an A because they all got a score of 36 or higher in that particular test. I found that so strange, but I won't question his authority. I'm sure he has his reasons.

Another professor I know uses a 10,000,000 point system (Yes, you read that right: ten million). It's not 10,000,000 items per se. He just makes the point values for each item 1000-2000 points (if I remember correctly) for his exams and exercises. He argues that it makes the students take his class more seriously. I don't know if that's true but whatever suits you, I guess.

For me, I just use the box-standard percentage system. 55% Exams, 20% Quizzes, 10% Final Project, 10% Class Assignments and Exercises, and 5% for Class Participation and Attendance. Also, I remove the statistically difficult items from my exams (which I define are items where 50% of the class got wrong). Those who do get these items right are not penalized. I just simply lower the denominator relative to the number of statistically difficult items. I rationalize this because I believe that items given in an exam are not 100% reliable in gauging their performance and are subject to test error and all. Am I being too nice? lol.

I need some moral support...Today was the day. Final exam. 

Online exams are really stressful to monitor. You get emailed constantly about bugs that you have to deal with on the spot. Tonight was the same. But worse. 

The exam was in three parts, each part available at a certain time, to prevent cheating among other things. The exam took place between 15h and 18h. 

At 17h, a student who had 10% on the first exam and 30% at the second, returned zero lab reports and was overall absent and non-responsive even pre-lockdown, emailed me.

He told me he thought he would be able to finish the exam despite a terrible car accident he had two days ago. The whole story sounds like bullshit and he told me this after completing the first part and seeing the second and third part of the exam. He tells me he will send me all papers needed later (Why not now? Why telling me one hour before the end of the exam ?). 

I ask him to come talk to me on video on TEAMS right away (because I wanted to see if those ''50 stiches in the face'' were real) and also to tell him I didn't think it was wise to do a make up exam in two days. He would be in the same bad condition anyway...

He declines the meeting, telling me he is at the hospital right now getting the papers  for the make up exam (like....wut? Are you telling me you were doing the first part of the exam in transit to the hospital ? Or shortly after ? Non sense. )

He sends me 4 photos, the two firsts barely fitting with his story. The last photo, with no warning, is him soaked in blood and dripping. He is not in at an hospital in the picture. I close the photo right away and start crying.

I'm not paid enough for this.

Update : Emailed the admin. Apparently, the student told the same bullshit to his chem professor. The date of the accident is not the same as the date he told me. Also, it was his second declared accident this semester.

I need to go to New Orleans next week for the memorial and to help my house-bound grandmother. My cousin was the one that lived with her so it's causing a lot of issues. We need to work on getting her more accessible items to maintain independent living as much as possible. 

Anyway. I have no internet access there that is strong enough to stream my zoom lectures. I got a mifi from the University but I tried it today and it wasn't strong enough to keep a steady feed going. 

I was hoping someone at a University/College there could help me. I know most universities have guest wifi accounts and strong internet. I stay very close to the Northshore Technical Community College- Lacombe campus, but am willing to travel wherever I need to get internet.

Never done this, but I might now. Anyone here have experience? Will I be pestered by the publisher sales rep ad nauseum? Lol, I am genuinely interested in the book, just don’t want to be bothered.

Background: took over course shells from another prof 3 years ago and never bothered changing anything. As we shift things to online delivery for 20Fall, now is good time to strongly consider switching textbook. There are probably 2-3 solid options, but I really like this book we have NOT, been using for my course at this school. We have to get our book orders in by July, so in a bit of a crunch, but have time. 

Oh also, my higherups all know of this plan and they’ve given me free reign to do whatever I want with this course. Specifically, they instructed me not to go through our admin process with the bookstore, because “they are incompetent, don’t waste your time” (Dean, 2020)

Btw it was just me, my chair forgot. 

So the panel asks their questions, it became clear the student didnt time manage very well and didnt ask for an extension. If he had we could of discussed it.

I felt fantastic after that.

Now I do use the publishers exams as a way to catch the cheaters and make sure to inform the class after the first exam to ensure they are all on warning.

However, for higher stakes exams I write my own exams and this past semester put copyright all through the solutions.  I make the solutions available to help my students learn.

gtc680,2020-05-30T06:30:29Z,NA,Professors,"Hi all,

I posted this a few days back while upset, and got downvoted within seconds, so I took it down. Posting again as I need to own my feelings on this. 

I’ve recently discovered that my courses will be fully online for 2020-2021. 

To provide some context: I have two part-time, pro rata contracts in two colleges, one with an extremely heavy teaching load.  The latter institution already has full-time expectations of part-timers’ availability, making it a stressful post.  Pre-pandemic I was on the verge of quitting  because of serious workload vs pay concerns but now, while eternally grateful to still have a job, I’m stuck.

The thought of having to teach online for a full year, with the doubled (in my experience, at least) workload, new courses and associated stress, has me freaking out. I’m not certain I can manage it, either in terms of performing my duties adequately or maintaining my physical or mental health (both of which I struggle with, even in ordinary circumstances). After years of effort to keep myself from relapse following a mental health crisis, and just about succeeding, I’m worried that this is going to be the straw to break the camel’s back. I have just about managed these past two months, running on fumes, with the summer on the horizon keeping me going - I’m not sure if I could do this for an entire academic year, with no respite or promise of an approaching light at the end of the tunnel. I will have to put in huge work over the summer to design new courses and update old ones for online delivery, but as I’m on a 9-month contract I will be doing it unpaid. While I love what I do, I can’t afford to work for free - I need to do other work during the summer to tide me over financially. 

I’m not sure why I’m posting - I’m just filled with dread and despair looking at the year ahead and have a strong desire to run for the hills, although that’s neither an option for me nor something I’d ever inflict on my similarly-beleaguered colleagues!

I guess I thought y’all would understand the struggle.  I’m far from work-shy, but as a human I have physical, mental (and temporal!) limitations. I’m worried that next year is going to be hell. 

Thanks for reading and sorry for being so negative - I think I probably just need a hug!!

Update: I’m quite new to Reddit so not sure how to send a general reply, but, from the bottom of my heart, thank you all so much for your kindness, generosity, empathy and supportive advice.

I submitted my first big grant (R01) proposal today as a TT Assistant Professor at an R1, nearing the end of my first year. I shot for the moon by asking for nearly $500k/yr in directs.

My blackboard skills are generally pretty good (big writing, clear, filling the board, use of colors, etc.).  However, I could always use a bit of improvement when it comes to penmanship and diagrams.  Also, it seems like my writing on the whiteboard looks considerably worse for reasons that are a mystery to me.  Things do seem to improve over the years, but over the next year I'd like to make a real effort to improve my artistic and handwriting skills on the board.  

This is spawned mostly from thinking about how classes will be in the fall.  I'd like to just videotape lectures as though I'm in a real classroom.  This means the blackboard must be nice!

gsdy8q,2020-05-28T16:19:40Z,NA,Professors,"I teach multiple introductory-advanced foreign language classes at my institution and, with the switch to distance learning, found it impossible to prevent students from cheating their way through online exams. Regardless of the type of assignment (vocabulary, grammar, essay), most students performed near impeccably on sections where many of them, prior to the shift to online learning, couldn't even string together a coherent sentence. The only areas where I was able to truly determine if they were genuinely 'taking the exam' were listening and open-ended cultural sections, based on reading and my class presentations (unsurprisingly, these were frequently left blank).

Call me skeptical, but I have zero confidence that my students did not get outside help while completing their exams, despite me telling them (and including in the instructions for the exam itself) that soliciting outside help (via an online translator or another person) is strictly prohibited and that doing so is a clear case of academic dishonesty. Most signs point to Google translate, which is incredibly effective for elementary-intermediate language competency. It might not be able to translate ""paper jam"" well, but it can fill in blanks and write short essays like a champ.

My initial approach to all of this was--oh well, we're in triage. This isn't an authentic online teaching experience. My students will use the resources available to them. But after experiencing three exams full of rampant cheating, I cannot honestly say that my students have even come close to learning to speak a second language. Maybe learning how to press CTRL+C &amp; CTRL+V, but that might be the extent of it.

Which leads me to my main question: for those of you that have taught foreign languages online prior to the pandemic, how do you effectively assess the student learning? How do you ensure that they are not using an online translator (or receiving another kind of outside help) and that their responses are genuine? And, if they do cheat, how do you deal with it?

griwzr,2020-05-27T08:36:03Z,NA,Professors,"**Short post**: What might be the benefits or plans of actions for teaching intro science courses in a hybrid fashion where half of the students are in class and half online (not hybrid where some/half of the class sessions occur in person).


**Longer post**:
My (quite small) liberal arts college is planning to do face to face instruction where we can in the fall. As a new department chair, I'm now faced with suggesting ideas and formats to my colleagues on how they can successfully teach their courses while limiting the number of students we have in a room at any given time. We have been told that we can instruct these courses in any format we feel comfortable (online, hybrid, full face to face with social distancing); however I have definitely felt some pressure from administration to have as much face to face interaction as possible. This is primarily a problem for our intro courses (think Intro biology, chemistry, etc. with 40-60 students and no rooms where social distancing would be possible).

One method that our admin has mentioned many times is hybrid: half in person/half online. However, I'm struggling to see how this wouldn't end up resulting in a lower quality version of both types of instruction. We aren't being given new tech to help us transition, so would be asked to record our lectures on our laptops for those ""attending class online"". This essentially means I'm now stuck lecturing within a very narrow range of the front of the class, can't use the whiteboard (or at least very much of it) because of legibility and sight lines, and would struggle to get much benefit from in-class worksheets and problem sets due to difficulties engaging with both in person and online students (I generally treat work sheets and case studies as opportunities to work with students individually or in small groups as I walk around the classroom). 

At the end of the day, I feel like this is the worst version of teaching online, but now my in-person students are getting low quality lectures as well. I would rather just teach an effective online course with as much infrastructure as possible. But I now need to discuss options with my colleagues and would like some feedback on whether I could build an effective class in this format, both to appease admin a bit and potentially to present to my department how this format may actually work (and not be a bad manager who just piles crap on one of admin's ideas without researching to see if it can be done well first).",t2_40hnr,FALSE,NA,0,FALSE,Benefits of hybrid classroom (half students in person and half online)?,NA,r/Professors,FALSE,6,NA,0,NA,NA,FALSE,t3_griwzr,FALSE,dark,0.93,NA,public,12,0,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,FALSE,12,NA,FALSE,self,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,1590611763,text,6,NA,NA,text,self.Professors,TRUE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short post&lt;/strong&gt;: What might be the benefits or plans of actions for teaching intro science courses in a hybrid fashion where half of the students are in class and half online (not hybrid where some/half of the class sessions occur in person).&lt;/p&gt;

The student sent me an email making weird excuses (and actual lies) about why they couldn't do several things

They sent me another email (without addressing any of the prior points) making other weird excuses and saying that their group members were mean to them and that their tutor (discussion leading casual academic in the UK and Australian uni system) was racist to them in class

I asked the tutor and the tutor was just completely baffled and said I can ask anyone in class if they were ever racist

I replied back saying that their group project score was actually the highest among their assessment portions (they got close to 0s on their individual assessment items) and that I'll look into the racism claim and told them to give me any specifics if they have any

They missed two quizzes without any proper cause / notices. They complained that their web browser didn't work so we just let them have a retake. They didn't take it.

Now they are communicating through the university student center saying that they are having suicidal thoughts and so they want to retake the quizzes

2. I know someone who took their own life and I ABHOR it when people joke about suicidal thoughts or talk about it lightly, let alone try to use it for their personal gains
3. I can't rule out the possibility that the student actually somehow felt racially prejudiced toward and also is having suicidal thoughts which makes me confused about how I actually even need to feel right now

IHE just shared this article - https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/05/26/colleges-expect-few-new-international-students-will-make-it-their-campuses-fall - about how enrollment of international students will be dropping in the fall.

These quotes stood out to me:

""The University of Arizona, for example, is projecting losses of 80 percent for new international students and 30 percent for continuing international students, an outcome that translates into a projected $33.1 million revenue loss.""

""A recent survey by the Institute of International Education found that 88 percent of colleges expect international enrollment to decrease in the coming year, and 70 percent anticipate that some international students will not be able to come to their campuses for in-person classes this fall.

The chances current international students can return to their campuses look much better: colleges reported that 92 percent of their current international students remain in the U.S.

On par with that figure, Arizona surveyed about half its 4,000 international students and determined that 89 percent of those who responded remain in the U.S., White said.""

On the other hand, editing my videos has been a pain. I'm using Microsoft Photos, the basic editor that came with my computer. I have two main issues with it:

1. There is no way (as far as I can tell) to cut out a portion of the video. So if I make a mistake, I have to trim my video into 2 videos and use an online merger to put them together. If I make 2 mistakes... 3 videos. Not fun.
2. It is pretty difficult to get the video to trim at the precise moment I want. You have to do it by dragging a point to the time in the video, and often times it just won't land on the exact time I'm trying for. It would be so nice if I could just type in the time stamps of my desired start/end times.

Any recommendations for something else? I'm also hoping to avoid anything with a steep learning curve. I don't want to sound lazy, but right now teaching has kept me so busy that I don't have much time to spare. After doing some internet research I downloaded a free program called Shotcut. It seems like a great program, but kind of overkill for what I need, and definitely more of a time investment to learn.

TLDR: I am looking for a video editing program that is as simple and user-friendly as possible, while allowing me to 1) cut out portions of my videos without having to make individual videos and stitch them together, and 2) choose start/end times accurately when cutting the video. Feature 1) is definitely the priority, but 2) would be nice.

Certainly true, but it made me wonder: what *are* their odds like lately? I just had a look at their recent placements in History (bless them, they post this data online!). Here's the data from the Princeton History Ph.D. program, 2016-2019:*

&amp;nbsp;

2019:

15 new PhDs

2 tenure-track placements

Odds: 13%

&amp;nbsp;

2018:

23 new PhDs

4 tenure-track placements

Odds: 17%

&amp;nbsp;

2017:

15 new PhDs

5 tenure-track placements

Odds: 33%

&amp;nbsp;

2016:

17 new PhDs

2 tenure-track placements 

Odds: 11%

&amp;nbsp;

(Granted: *some* graduates who got non-TT gigs at graduation have surely found TT jobs by now. But we don't know how many...)

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Also, this is only *self-reported* placement. I'm assuming that the full numbers may be even worse. Graduates are less likely, I figure, to report when they're adjuncts than when they've landed a TT gig or a great Postdoc.

gpa567,2020-05-23T14:41:06Z,NA,Professors,"This question has been bugging me for some time. I've taught online at the university and community college level and have noticed that some professors have prerecorded lectures and do minimal grading for online sections (especially in Summer terms). As we all know, the pay for Part Time Adjunct positions are bottom of the barrel and one needs at least 5 sections to merely get by.

 Since the lectures are prerecorded and if one was an efficient grader, could one theoretically use the same materials and teach the same course (ex. World Civ I) at multiple institutions online? I feel like this must be a breach of some law somehow, but I am curious to know how? Likewise, couldn't one teach online at multiple schools around the world and streamline the workload, but also adhere to the curriculum requirements?

Instead of teaching the 3 hours a day for pennies, one could teach the SAME material to a wider audience at the SAME rate, but could pull together a better income. If you get paid roughly 1200 per credit hour at CC online so a 3 credit hour course is 2800 before taxes and then do that at 5 different schools for the same course it would be 14000 dollars with 5 times the amount of grading BUT since it's online you could find a way to streamline that as well. Since most part time instructor have about 2-3 sections per school you could do that over and over again domestic and abroad with prerecorded lectures at  lets say 5 schools and it would be like having a total of 15 sections x 3 credit hours which is to say, $50,000  a semester for online classes.

I never had a class retracted from me in three years. I'm assuming this is all systems-go for now.

At first, I was happy due to the fact that I have another job. So, while I knew it would be a lot of prep work, it works out with my FT job. Okay, just record myself for a total of one hour (broken up into 5-10 mins)? Okay. I can do that. Then, the pandemic happened.

Other times, they are asking me questions every five mins. I politely try to tell them that I'm working. They just don't get it. They say they do, but that's out the ear in an hour. Case in point--dad just walked in my room asking for something...now my parents are bickering...this will later turn into an argument. It's just the morning...

Originally I planned on recording myself at a room in the university's library. Now the university is closed. I know a lot of you all that are parents had to do things for class during ""off hours"" when the kids are asleep. How did you all manage?  I'm already dreading this.

The context is that two universities ""relatively"" close to me have an open assistant professor position, but their application deadlines and starting dates are different. So I can't apply to both at the same time, see who accepts me, and then make a choice.

I can imagine a university won't like that you're applying for another position immediately. In case the application fails I would happily stay at that university though. If successful, I can imagine to continue collaborations with that university as well.

A quote that stood out to me is this: ""The University of California Board of Regents voted 23 to 0 to approve President Janet Napolitano's plan to phase out use of the SAT and ACT over five years and to replace them with a new test to be developed by University of California faculty members.""

It mainly stood out to me because I'm sure those faculty members are gonna love being forced to create a new test from scratch. /s

This quote also stood out to me: ""If no new test is available by 2025, the state will go fully test blind and eliminate the role of standardized testing in admissions.""

Given that U of Cali is willing to go fully test blind by 2025 if no new test can be made, this got me wondering what students are like at schools that are already test blind. 

So, if you have worked at a college or university that has gone test blind, what are the students like there?",t2_6q1gb,FALSE,NA,0,FALSE,Feedback from those of you at test optional or test blind institutions,NA,r/Professors,FALSE,6,NA,0,NA,NA,FALSE,t3_gormqv,FALSE,dark,1,NA,public,7,0,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,FALSE,7,NA,FALSE,self,0,NA,NA,self,NA,TRUE,NA,1590209707,text,6,NA,NA,text,self.Professors,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm writing to you regarding my grades.

I know my mid-term was very bad and I thank you for the time you took explaining where I went wrong. However, I consider that I actually did a stellar job on questions 2 and 4 and I strongly urge you to reconsider the amount of awarded points.

Additionally, I would like to take this opportunity to negotiate a higher amount of points. Your class is about business and negotiations, so I would like to set up a space where I could potentially increase my grade through negotiation.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing to you regarding my grades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know my mid-term was very bad and I thank you for the time you took explaining where I went wrong. However, I consider that I actually did a stellar job on questions 2 and 4 and I strongly urge you to reconsider the amount of awarded points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I would like to take this opportunity to negotiate a higher amount of points. Your class is about business and negotiations, so I would like to set up a space where I could potentially increase my grade through negotiation. I am offering to study very hard and to obtain a great grade on my final. Don&amp;#39;t take it the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;

I have set up a calendly link, with a bunch of available times (at end of post). If you have marking to do, register for any of those times. It will put a 60 minute session in both our calendars with zoom meeting link. At scheduled time, go to the zoom meeting, we say hello, what we are going to mark, and then we just mark for 50 minutes separately, check in at the end of the meeting time to discuss what we got done.  

I am anti admin so the goal is not to create useless meetings, or spend more time on zoom. The goal is to get marking done. You work on your own marking. Just with brief discussion at start and end.  

Benefit of it might be this- 1. Having marking meetings in my calendar blocks out time, means the time not available for other stuff like admin meetings. 2. Short cut procrastination- Having an actual start time in calendar for marking mean I just mark rather than cleaning the house first. 3. Brief social pressure contract idea might also help keep on task. 4. Also short deadlines- mark for 50 minutes in a session. Kind of like pomodoro.  If not your thing, no probs.

My institution is keeping classes online for the remainder of the year. To cut adjunct costs our class sizes will be increased in Business courses from 40 to 80 for undergraduates per class (from 30 to 60 for postgrad). 

These subjects have no lectures, as content was previously delivered according to the flipped classroom model, with short 'lecture' like videos, readings and activities being on the LMS for completion each week by students before attending their 'tutorial'. These 2 hour tutorials are now live Zoom classes.

Classes remain 'synchronous' meaning each week there is 2 hour live Zoom tutorial one for each group of 80 students. This Zoom session is run by a single staff member. This staff member is responsible (theoretically) for being the first point of inquiry for all 80 students in the class as well as the marker of all assessment tasks for the semester.  Naturally, many staff will be taking more than 1 class in each subject, and each subject is also overseen by a coordinator (who is usually the teaching member of staff for at least some of the classes).

Additionally some subjects have 'in-class' group presentations as a requirement. This means marking of these is usually done by the academic in class time, and so there is no marking time/budget for these tasks.

As staff we've been asked to come up with ideas on how to make this work to suggest to management. Especially as staff have expressed concern about trying to manage 80 individuals in a single meeting or even the feasibility of using the breakout rooms for so many to monitor with just a single academic.

Has anyone ever tried to teach that many students in a single online class environment?

Does anyone have any ideas, strategies, workarounds etc that you can suggest?

&gt;Just when I thought this term couldn't get any worse in light of recent events, I am about to seem like the most idiotic person you've ever met, but I'm a student in your CS101 class when I should have been in your CS150 class.

I don't know how different the classes are, so maybe there could be an exception where I just do a select amount of work, that would be the best-case scenario.

gnm0cp,2020-05-20T19:53:35Z,NA,Professors,"Sorry for this post. I have to let some things off my chest, and I wasn't sure where to post it. I always admired this sub.

To be clear, I'm not a full-time professor. I'm a staff member at a local university that also adjuncts on the side, but only once a year. Still, I get new courses every time I teach, and the prep time is always, well, a  lot. My ""9-5"" job is actually pretty good. The problem is that I'm insanely bored. But it's a decent pay, about a little under what an AP professor would make in my field.  I love teaching, but I also love research.  I'm in the social sciences, and my research topics do not (as of now) require lab space. If you think about it, I have it good--decent, secure job that pays with access to a large R1's resources.  I just don't have time to do research working 40 +hours a week. I understand that a lot of professor's don't have this luxury, either.

I think it's partial imposter syndrome. For example, last night I was looking at someone's CV and they have so many projects and a very active research agenda. Their topics align with mine.  They're currently a post-doc. Frankly, I don't know how I can go to a post-doc or another temp job after I have all these work-paid benefits.  But I'm a little sad that I haven't gotten a research agenda as large, especially with all my ideas.  I know academia is very hard to get into, and once you're in, you're not promised much. I looked at federal jobs and think tanks, but I did some research and for some positions, they're pretty strict about you going to conferences. In other words, you need to ask *permission* to do so. My current job, frankly, doesn't GAF. But on the topic of conferences, a lot of times when I go, I feel so out of precisely out place, because I am not a professor.  I work on papers by myself. I don't have any co-authors, and it takes \*forever\* to send something out. I'm craving the community aspect.  Sometimes I get intellectual highs from conferences, and then, it just deflates. I feel like a wall flower. Also, as a super FYI, I have a lot of friends in academia and some are really not doing well, because they don't have the support system.

I have to let some things off my chest, and I wasn&amp;#39;t sure where to post it. I always admired this sub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I&amp;#39;m not a full-time professor. I&amp;#39;m a staff member at a local university that also adjuncts on the side, but only once a year. Still, I get new courses every time I teach, and the prep time is always, well, a  lot. My &amp;quot;9-5&amp;quot; job is actually pretty good. The problem is that I&amp;#39;m insanely bored. But it&amp;#39;s a decent pay, about a little under what an AP professor would make in my field.  I love teaching, but I also love research.  I&amp;#39;m in the social sciences, and my research topics do not (as of now) require lab space. If you think about it, I have it good--decent, secure job that pays with access to a large R1&amp;#39;s resources.  I just don&amp;#39;t have time to do research working 40 +hours a week. I understand that a lot of professor&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t have this luxury, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s partial imposter syndrome. For example, last night I was looking at someone&amp;#39;s CV and they have so many projects and a very active research agenda. Their topics align with mine.  They&amp;#39;re currently a post-doc. Frankly, I don&amp;#39;t know how I can go to a post-doc or another temp job after I have all these work-paid benefits.  But I&amp;#39;m a little sad that I haven&amp;#39;t gotten a research agenda as large, especially with all my ideas.  I know academia is very hard to get into, and once you&amp;#39;re in, you&amp;#39;re not promised much. I looked at federal jobs and think tanks, but I did some research and for some positions, they&amp;#39;re pretty strict about you going to conferences. In other words, you need to ask &lt;em&gt;permission&lt;/em&gt; to do so. My current job, frankly, doesn&amp;#39;t GAF. But on the topic of conferences, a lot of times when I go, I feel so out of precisely out place, because I am not a professor.  I work on papers by myself. I don&amp;#39;t have any co-authors, and it takes *forever* to send something out. I&amp;#39;m craving the community aspect.  Sometimes I get intellectual highs from conferences, and then, it just deflates. I feel like a wall flower. Also, as a super FYI, I have a lot of friends in academia and some are really not doing well, because they don&amp;#39;t have the support system. Some of my other friends, however, have gotten lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks for listening. Stay safe and well.&lt;/p&gt;

I just read this article from Inside Higher Ed - https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/05/19/who-owns-all-course-content-youre-putting-online

And it got me wondering what copyright protections (if any) you have at your institution?

With that said, there are two sections that stood out to me.

One: ""U.S. copyright law includes a work-for-hire doctrine saying that works prepared in the scope of employment belong to the employer, not the employee (there are exceptions for independent contractors and commissioned works). Classroom professors have long enjoyed a cultural exemption to this statute, however: while they’re paid to teach and do research, their lectures, syllabi and other nonpatentable work almost always belong to them, not the university.

“If you just read the Copyright Act and didn’t work in academe, you might think articles and lectures belong to the school,” Sprigman said. “But it hasn’t usually worked out that way.”""

-----

And two: ""In that case, colleges and universities might seek to offer courses at scale by “widely claiming copyright ownership of those classes’ videos, presentations and associated materials. Those things will all start to look like patentable inventions.”

The risk or the opportunity, depending on where one stands, is having various instructors offer the same exact course using a playbook originally written by someone else. Higher education does not traditionally operate this way. Even professors who teach different sections of the same course put their own stamps on it, bringing insights from their own research and experiences.""

To make this worse, Student A is supposed to be graduating, the class is required for his program, and he was doing well in the class.

He also submitted it 36 hours before the deadline so it's not like he ran out of time. And he never emailed me about having issues with the project. I would have helped him with it or advised him that he'd still have a B even if he chose not to do the project if he had. No, instead, he got himself a zero on the project, an F in the class, and an academic integrity report filed against both him and Student B.

REALLY sweet kid, perfect attendance, does all his work. Maybe.He submits everything. but there is a clear difference between what he is able to do in class, and what he does at home. My B.S. meter started going off long before I reached out to his previous professor, who told me the same thing. He switched to more in-class writing and drafting, and the student (let's call him Scott) failed.

This time around, quarantine sent everyone home mid-March. And while I had already begun to suspect him of getting ""help"" (you could tell by the turns of phrase, ease of expression that in no way reflected his actual linguistic output) so now, THERE IS NO IN-CLASS WRITING. His last two essays have been gorgeously fluid (curiously, also incredibly poorly formatted - my suspicion is that some one was writing the text, but then he never learned how to format, so he just did what he could and submitted.) I reported my suspicion along with work samples, screenshots, details, etc.. to the director of our program, the Chair, and the director of Accessibility Services who knows him well (and has had her own issues with him), but nothing ever came of it. 

I do a final essay in lieu of exam; I assign it the last class, before Finals Week starts, and it is due the day after finals week ends. It is their 4th or 5th essay, and after all those multi-draft essays, they'd darn well be able to give me 1,200 words, MLA formatted, with 5+ cited sources (in text and Works Cited, and a mixture of print and electronic sources). They had around 9 days. 

Normally, I will get 2-5 emails PER WEEK from ""Scott"" asking questions about this and that. Far from annoying, I think it's great. The past 8 days? NOTHING.

gm9cbk,2020-05-18T16:21:32Z,NA,Professors,"**TL;DR — Please help me tell this student that he's failed my course and will have to retake it.**

For the entire semester, I told my students that there are no strict due dates on any assignments. As long as they turned everything in by the end of the course, then they'd be just fine.

I assigned only one project after the campus closed. Adobe made their programs accessible to students. I understand that not every student has Internet access or adequate hardware for said programs. So, I emailed all students 1-2 times a week, reminding them that if they needed an extension after the course ending date (waiting for the campus computer labs to reopen), then to let me know before I have to put final grades in. To let students know their overall grade status, I updated grades daily for them to see online. The students who contacted me before the course's end, were awarded temporary incomplete grades.

It has been a week after grades were put in and one student who has failed the course emailed me saying that they ""may need more time to complete the work."" They said it's because of a crashed hard drive and not being able to get it fixed, due to the pandemic and shops closing. The student then asked if there is an opportunity for to complete the work or if it's too late. 

The student:

* rarely showed up to class
* never turned in any of his assignments before the campus closing (which is okay, I guess, because I did say that they had until the end of the semester to turn in everything)
* never contacted me before the class ended
* has missing assignments that were given prior to the campus closing
* turned in the final project before the course ended
* turned in a few assignments online after the emails he sent me

I emailed the student back explaining why they are not eligible for an incomplete grade...

The student then sent what was supposed to be a delayed ""error"" message. This message only contained what his email address was. There was no other context. The student quickly sent another email after that one, saying that they attempted to email me ""around March or April but didn't realize the email didn't fully go through until now.""

glb5py,2020-05-17T03:14:42Z,NA,Professors,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice over an issue that’s bugged me for a few years now.  I teach undergraduate engineering students a mandatory technical communications course.  It’s a big program, with each class having 40-60 students in a large research university.  I’ve been doing this for a few years now and while the students enjoy the course and the content, I’ve always struggled with the grading scheme (and what I am critiqued most often for).  For context, my PhD is in business, not engineering, although I do have a science undergrad.  I was brought on specifically for my skillset in business and writing.  I do professional development and engineering business-type content, such as role-playing and case-based teaching with them.

My courses are typically graded on a standard 0-100% scale, with the course average usually in the 75-78% (B-B+) range, as dictated by the department (higher than 80/A- is an issue).  My assignments typically consist of written content, much of it reflection/introspection based.  All of it is subjective.  My students are used to courses where they start with a baseline of 100% and then lose marks to whatever they get, as you can imagine in STEM based course work.  My course is one of the only ones they take that is graded subjectively.  While I try to explain to them that their work in my course assumes roughly a 60% “satisfactory” baseline where they then *earn up*, many of them still report back to me “what did I do wrong?”  It’s a hard mentality to shake I fear.  

I utilize a rubric but I am also loathe to provide the fully detailed rubric upfront, instead opting for guidelines and clear instructions.  Students have asked for the rubric in advance but my issue is that if I tell them exactly what to do, then that’s what they’ll do.  It leaves little room for creativity or deep thought and tends to convert longer written work into short answer (i.e. “you asked this, so I answered that.”).  Students accuse me sometimes of a mystery grading approach where if I like it, they do well, and if I don’t, they don’t.  I think that’s overly simplified but I can’t say that’s entirely wrong - it’s the nature of subjective evaluation.  On the other hand, most students tend to score a low-70 (B) grade so it’s not like I’m failing students regularly for this.  The people with issues are often the ones who expect to score higher.

Part of my issue is that I find the 0-100 approach for this course somewhat inappropriate.  A pass/fail approach is too coarse, but the 0-100 approach is far more fine-grained than necessary.  As far as my Program Director and the engineering accreditation body is concerned, students really just need to meet or exceed expectations.  Is there an appreciable difference between 62 and 76?  Of course.  But between 72 and 74 or 77 and 78?  Probably not.  

In this regard, my Program Director has already told me that I can have some latitude with the grading for this coming term.  If I were to adopt a does not meet/meets/exceeds expectation approach which then maps to numerical values, that could be considered.  Ultimately, it’s up to me.  The problem is that I’m struggling to develop a system that makes sense, is fair and more transparent, but also doesn’t saddle me with department-eyebrow-raising averages (either low or high).  I should also have a system that can accommodate high achievers that perhaps need to chase a scholarship or really are just submitting exceptional work.

Before I took over the course the old instructor used to have a simple rule that if you had any spelling mistakes you were capped at a 70.  It seemed stupid and unfair to me, but I realize now was probably designed to introduce variance, less everyone just get a high mark for following instructions.  I can’t introduce brutal midterms or tests to knock down averages, so I need to be thoughtful throughout the term.

I’m really open to any ideas and feedback here.  I've been a university instructor for 6 years now but still have a lot to learn.  I’d appreciate any wisdom or insights that the community might provide.  I’ll also try to answer any questions that might help clarify.  Thanks!",t2_4yc26,FALSE,NA,0,FALSE,Seeking help on developing an appropriate grading approach [long/detailed],NA,r/Professors,FALSE,6,NA,0,NA,NA,FALSE,t3_glb5py,FALSE,dark,0.87,NA,public,6,0,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,FALSE,6,NA,FALSE,self,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,1589728482,text,6,NA,NA,text,self.Professors,FALSE,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice over an issue that’s bugged me for a few years now.  I teach undergraduate engineering students a mandatory technical communications course.  It’s a big program, with each class having 40-60 students in a large research university.  I’ve been doing this for a few years now and while the students enjoy the course and the content, I’ve always struggled with the grading scheme (and what I am critiqued most often for).  For context, my PhD is in business, not engineering, although I do have a science undergrad.  I was brought on specifically for my skillset in business and writing.  I do professional development and engineering business-type content, such as role-playing and case-based teaching with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My courses are typically graded on a standard 0-100% scale, with the course average usually in the 75-78% (B-B+) range, as dictated by the department (higher than 80/A- is an issue).  My assignments typically consist of written content, much of it reflection/introspection based.  All of it is subjective.  My students are used to courses where they start with a baseline of 100% and then lose marks to whatever they get, as you can imagine in STEM based course work.  My course is one of the only ones they take that is graded subjectively.  While I try to explain to them that their work in my course assumes roughly a 60% “satisfactory” baseline where they then &lt;em&gt;earn up&lt;/em&gt;, many of them still report back to me “what did I do wrong?”  It’s a hard mentality to shake I fear.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I utilize a rubric but I am also loathe to provide the fully detailed rubric upfront, instead opting for guidelines and clear instructions.  Students have asked for the rubric in advance but my issue is that if I tell them exactly what to do, then that’s what they’ll do.  It leaves little room for creativity or deep thought and tends to convert longer written work into short answer (i.e. “you asked this, so I answered that.”).  Students accuse me sometimes of a mystery grading approach where if I like it, they do well, and if I don’t, they don’t.  I think that’s overly simplified but I can’t say that’s entirely wrong - it’s the nature of subjective evaluation.  On the other hand, most students tend to score a low-70 (B) grade so it’s not like I’m failing students regularly for this.  The people with issues are often the ones who expect to score higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of my issue is that I find the 0-100 approach for this course somewhat inappropriate.  A pass/fail approach is too coarse, but the 0-100 approach is far more fine-grained than necessary.  As far as my Program Director and the engineering accreditation body is concerned, students really just need to meet or exceed expectations.  Is there an appreciable difference between 62 and 76?  Of course.  But between 72 and 74 or 77 and 78?  Probably not.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, my Program Director has already told me that I can have some latitude with the grading for this coming term.  If I were to adopt a does not meet/meets/exceeds expectation approach which then maps to numerical values, that could be considered.  Ultimately, it’s up to me.

My spring semester has just ended and in a couple days I'll turn in final grades and be done.

Normally this is an exciting time for me, as it marks the end of the school year, and the freedom to stay at home or do whatever, and to not have to be on a schedule, go into campus, etc.

But year it just feels meh. After I turn in final grades, I'll be going from spending time at home to spending time at home. Still plenty of screen time and tasks to do online, prep for next semester fully online from the start.

I suspect that I've been holding together pretty well up until now with shelter in place because I always felt like, ""ok, I just need to make it until May 15, then we'll be done"". But Covid isn't done, shelter in place isn't done, and even as things open up, it will be gradual. And travel won't be happening, which is something that means more to me than I had realized.

I just feel like, shit, now I'm trapped at home with no structure or momentum.  I regret not signing up for summer classes way back when.

Sorry, thanks for letting me vent.

Anyone have a way of handling summer break this year that sounds like it's going to work for you?

gkkeyo,2020-05-15T19:52:33Z,NA,Professors,"I cannot adequately describe the feeling of the last three years \[EDIT: just did the math... going on 5!\], having a Chair who is just an all-around GOOD fucking human being.

I've been teaching for almost 3 decades: high school exclusively 1992-2006, high school full time with a little part time college on the side 2006-2011, college exclusively, 2011-2019, and recently, back to full-time high school with a little college on the side. And in ALL THAT TIME, I can count on one hand the number of administrators and/or Chairs who did not rub me in some way wrong, or around whom I didn't feel like I had to watch what I said or did.

Granted, part of that is me - I don't trust easily, but that is with some reason. Anyway...

This guy... is great. His door is always open. He explains things brilliantly. He is adept in policy, pedagogy, politics. He will spare you the time; he is not one of those always-looking-at-his-watch types.  He always errs on the side of protecting instructors' interests, and is a true advocate when needed. He is measured, circumspect, and fair. He trusts, and therefore earns trust. It took me a semester to decide this about him after he took over for the previous chair (who wasn't bad, relatively speaking, but who had a treacherous, political side to her), and in the many semesters since, it has been like a weight lifted off me.

As enrollment declined - 10%, 20%, 30% - he worked to protect as many sections as he could, arguing that increasing class sizes to save money was counterproductive (especially in light of clear best practices research showing that the class sizes the college was pushing for in my field - Composition, developmental, specifically - were close to DOUBLE what the CCCC recommended). He instituted the most liberal interpretation possible of the college's sudden demands to change how courses were offered to adjuncts, and did so in a way that as transparent as the College would allow. The number of adjuncts in our department shrank -- 70, 65, 60, 55 ( I think we're in the 40s now) -- and NOBODY could lay any blame at the Chair's feet. He literally did everything that he could -- even more, as when College policy was vague, he would weigh in in our favor and take any heat that came. Even the most venomous, bitter, jaded, fuck-the-system, shoulda-retired-a-decade-ago veteran adjuncts (who quite rightly decried everything that was happening) had really very little to say about our Chair.

He has been supportive AF during the pandemic, and has given every one of us a set of broad parameter to operate within (mandated by the College and by existing department policies, where applicable), but then within those parameters, near total autonomy.

And if the declining enrollment wasn't bad enough already at community colleges in my area, COVID might have just killed it altogether. We'll see.  I have two classes for Fall 2020 (though they could still get plucked by a full-timer). But for the first time in 10+ years, Spring 2021, I have no classes. There just weren't enough sections. I have worked my way up the seniority schedule over a decade, but even as high as I have managed to get, given my limited availability, teaching during the day, I actually got no classes.

Something similar happened last year - I had three classes one term, one got cancelled due to under-enrollment, and two were plucked from me. But my Chair found me two replacement classes with some (ethical but still slick) maneuvering - all within contract and per the MOA, but the point is, he got it done, and got it done fast. And I was worried, but I never didn't trust him. So when he found me the classes, it wasn't *quite* like inevitability, but more like a confirmation of his role as Benevolent Presence. This was when I was only teaching college, so losing all of my classes would have been devastating.

Next year, I don't see that happening. But you know what? It's all good. I'll teach Fall 2021. There are always more English sections in Fall semesters anyway. And I \*know\* that if anything comes up, he'll email me. I'm not pacing, nervous, popping antacids, muttering distrust under my breath. I know that he has done every single thing he possibly could under the circumstances to make the landscape as good as it could possibly be for us, and there is no disingenuity in his voice when he says that things look... well, bleak... and he wishes there was something he could do. He really does!

At least I still have my high school gig. I hope.

So, my sign off is this: Not ""May the road rise up to meet you"" or anything generic like that. May you have a Chair like mine, even if it's just for a 4-year term.

 \-------------------------------------------

Hello everyone,

As your professor I would like the take the time to issue a point  of concern at this point in the class.  As many of you may know in  addition to teaching most professors maintain an active research agenda  regarding trends and phenomena in their field. It is with this in mind  that I want to take the time to tell you to please be very careful in these coming  days as we have an assignment due and I have noticed a pattern.

I am not sure what or who it is... I think it might be a secret  government conspiracy or aliens, or wizards, or wizard-aliens.  Regardless, right around the time assignments are due in my classes  horrible things seem to happen including but not limited to: sudden  internet outages, computers mysteriously malfunctioning, sudden trips to  the emergency room- only worsened by the emergency room staff  forgetting to give you a note… and yes many times around assignment due  dates relatives will face mortal peril. I do no kid you when I say I  once knew a student who lost 6 (yes six) grandparents over the course of two years... all mysteriously right around the time assignment were due.

So please be extra careful around assignment due dates. I suggest  you might consider buying a lucky rabbit’s foot or maybe go hunting for 4  leaf clovers. 

**So please kindly review the late policy for the class**  **AS OUR ASSIGNMENT IS DUE IN 4 DAYS**

Also always be sure to look at (1) the assignment overview (2) the  rubric and (3) previous student examples. Every assignment has these  three things to help you achieve success.

gkcflo,2020-05-15T12:33:26Z,NA,Professors,"I'm looking for ideas to mitigate a midterm gone wrong. Long story short, we gave an online test (my first one) with different versions and a time limit. Students did poorly, partly because they may not know as much as they think they knew (despite having all their materials to master it at their fingertips), partly because of the time constraint, and partly because of some ambiguous verbiage in one set of questions in particular. Each of these had rippling effects throughout the test, making it hard for me to figure out a ""fair"" way to address it. In short, there are 2 main parts of the exam. One part should be fine and I think just suffered from students running out of time, doing calculations on paper and misjudging the time to enter their answers to the online format. The second part had 2 versions - this was the part of the test that seemed to uniformly confuse them. The verbiage is the same that I have used in f2f classes without a problem, but I think with the shift to online, that for some reason it didn't land.

2. It is rude to email your professor after 8pm asking for final grade within 2 days from final exam, or expect them to reply right before the deadline, or work around your clock, not to mention a 2am call request.

3. Students often think it does not hurt to ask any presumptuous questions, but it does hurt. It hurts the professor's view of them and their chance of getting a good recommendation letter from professors.

How do I draft my reply in a way that is polite, professional and a powerful message?

UPDATE 2: Even after my student essentially threatened me for her own failure to turn in the work on time, I think I have decided that I will grade her exam and take off 10% of whatever her earned points were, and use that as her exam grade. I think this is still way too generous considering that this student signed and agreed to getting a zero if she did not turn her work in on time. This will give her a chance to pass, but still provide some consequences. I'm still flabbergasted that this student had 40 extra minutes to deal with technical difficulties like this, and still wasn't able to get it in on time... When I told her I would only take off 10%, she asked if she could finished the exam first since 10% is a lot... I said no and she needs to be submit as is, but how I will I know she finished more problems or not?? Sigh.


Since this online transition, my exams have been completed on paper, but pictures of their work must be inserted/scanned into a Word Doc or PDF and then submitted on our online platform by a designated time. Our normal class runs for one hour and 40 minutes, so I give my students 2 hours and 20 minutes to complete their exam, and then upload it. Thus, they get an extra 40 minutes to get their work into a document and submit it online, as well as deal with any technical difficulties that may arise.

The first exam online, I had a student (let's call her X) not submit it online by the designated time, and instead email me saying she was having some issues. I was lenient and gave her an extension since it was the first time.

The second exam rolls around and she does the same thing where she doesn't get it submitted by the designated time. I shouldn't have counted this, but again, I was lenient and gave her an extension.

The third exam she got it in on time, so I'm thinking she figured it out.

Now the final exam comes along and she does the same thing... she tries to submit it 4 minutes before the designated time and apparently her submission failed and she ended up not getting it in on time. She instead emailed me pictures of her work (Edit: it was only a screenshot of the first page, none of the other pages) before 7:30, so I (edit: don't necessarily) know it was finished -- she just didn't submit it the required way. Now mind you, before the final, I had all students sign a statement stating that they read and agree that all exams must be in by the designated time or else they automatically receive a 0. The statement they agreed to also reminded them that the extra 40 minutes is solely meant to deal with submitting the exam and any technical difficulties that may arise. If they take more time than the designated 1 hour and 40 minutes, then they risk not getting their exam in on time and getting a 0.

This final is worth 25% of their grade and this student has a B, so they will definitely not pass (a C is needed to pass). Now, other than these issues, this student has been very diligent with learning and was pretty much the only student to come to my office hours. I spent many hours working with her one on one, so I know she wants to do well and pass.

I'm at a loss of what to do. I don't want to fail this student because they have been trying really hard, but at the same time, I don't feel comfortable giving them THREE mulligans for not getting exams in on time, especially when she should know better by now.

&lt;p&gt;The first exam online, I had a student (let&amp;#39;s call her X) not submit it online by the designated time, and instead email me saying she was having some issues. I was lenient and gave her an extension since it was the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second exam rolls around and she does the same thing where she doesn&amp;#39;t get it submitted by the designated time. I shouldn&amp;#39;t have counted this, but again, I was lenient and gave her an extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third exam she got it in on time, so I&amp;#39;m thinking she figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the final exam comes along and she does the same thing... she tries to submit it 4 minutes before the designated time and apparently her submission failed and she ended up not getting it in on time. She instead emailed me pictures of her work (Edit: it was only a screenshot of the first page, none of the other pages) before 7:30, so I (edit: don&amp;#39;t necessarily) know it was finished -- she just didn&amp;#39;t submit it the required way. Now mind you, before the final, I had all students sign a statement stating that they read and agree that all exams must be in by the designated time or else they automatically receive a 0. The statement they agreed to also reminded them that the extra 40 minutes is solely meant to deal with submitting the exam and any technical difficulties that may arise. If they take more time than the designated 1 hour and 40 minutes, then they risk not getting their exam in on time and getting a 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final is worth 25% of their grade and this student has a B, so they will definitely not pass (a C is needed to pass). Now, other than these issues, this student has been very diligent with learning and was pretty much the only student to come to my office hours. I spent many hours working with her one on one, so I know she wants to do well and pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at a loss of what to do. I don&amp;#39;t want to fail this student because they have been trying really hard, but at the same time, I don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable giving them THREE mulligans for not getting exams in on time, especially when she should know better by now. Anyone help would be much appreciated -- I&amp;#39;m out of my mind stressed here.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, my institution has bitten the bullet and we are now scheduled to deliver courses via remote delivery this fall.  
  
I teach (among other courses) an introductory course for my discipline, so will be faced with numerous fresh faces - though none of them in person.  In the interest of trying to help them feel engaged with the course, the program, and the institution, I am strongly considering including an online discussion forum through something like Piazza.  
  
As an incentive for participation, I am also considering participation marks as part of their grade (maybe 5-10%).  In the past, I would never have considered participation marks.  I've always felt that grades should reflect knowledge or skills rather than things like showing up to class (attendance grades) or talking a lot (classic in-class participation grades).  But I find myself rethinking that position now that I need to create the feeling of being part of a learning community when people won't meet face to face.  I can't decide if that represents caving in or growing.  
   
In any event, I am wondering if any of you have experience doing participation credits for online forums like Piazza and if you would be willing to share how that has gone.  How do you actually decide how many points to award?  Does everyone simply get 100% (or 0% if they didn't participate)?  How do you determine who gets a 50% for participation? an 80%?  a 30%?

By the end of 2019, I felt like I was at a point in my life where I could continue my education and pursue a PhD. I laid out a plan for myself to brush up on the more advanced material I haven't touched since the master's, study for the GRE, get back into the literature, etc. And it actually was a *plan*, with clear goals and timelines.

Then we had a pandemic, and I suddenly needed to put a lot more energy into my job and moving everything online. I had to put my educational plans on hold for the time being. I recognized that I would not be able to be successful at my educational goals, my job, and my family obligations.

I have students who suddenly have a lot more on their plates. Maybe they have more hours at work because they work at a grocery store. Maybe they have kids who are now at home all the time and they need to take an active role in the kids' education. Maybe they have a toddler who would normally be in daycare, but now can't be. Maybe they've lost their job and are dealing with unemployment and uncertainty. Maybe it's a combination of all of this!

It's tough. I know. It's especially tough for people who are economically disadvantaged, who *need* the community college education to get the sort of job that will help lift them up and provide for their family.

Even when you feel like time is limited.

A degree is good, but a degree with mediocre grades can be detrimental. Not in the long term, but when you're first starting out in a career, your GPA does factor into the sort of job opportunities you have.

gj97w4,2020-05-13T18:20:24Z,NA,Professors,"I teach in the sciences and we are currently trying to figure out how to offer lab courses in a hybrid model for fall. Beyond all the weirdness that the 6' rule and PPE will bring, my labs require a fair bit of timed set up and can't be repeated easily. Further, lab A should be completed prior to lab B to be effective. I'm thinking forward on how to manage this and I can't figure out what I'm going to do if a student is absent. I can't ethically penalize a student for keeping themselves (and others) safe. Part of the fall messaging from admin is that we will be required to send any student who appears ill home. How do I even know what that looks like? 

My fear is that many students could abuse this fact to get out of labs and exams. Admin will require us to allow some kind of make up and that just isn't feasible.

Beyond all the weirdness that the 6&amp;#39; rule and PPE will bring, my labs require a fair bit of timed set up and can&amp;#39;t be repeated easily. Further, lab A should be completed prior to lab B to be effective. I&amp;#39;m thinking forward on how to manage this and I can&amp;#39;t figure out what I&amp;#39;m going to do if a student is absent. I can&amp;#39;t ethically penalize a student for keeping themselves (and others) safe. Part of the fall messaging from admin is that we will be required to send any student who appears ill home. How do I even know what that looks like? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fear is that many students could abuse this fact to get out of labs and exams. Admin will require us to allow some kind of make up and that just isn&amp;#39;t feasible.

gj4gba,2020-05-13T14:19:55Z,NA,Professors,"Dear loyal workers of Flailing University,

First off, let me start by making a distracting comment about how odd the situation feels and sharing what I think are some uncanny observations about “these times.” 

Next, I want to write something that sounds very empathic here. I want to put a lot of emphasis on saying how much I understand all your stresses now, ALL of them, every single one. I understand.

Of course, I need to place some blanket praise here about how much we appreciate all that hard work and perseverance everyone has shown. Because this email is going to every single person employed at the school, these statements will feel as personal and uplifting as a ""Thank You for Not Smoking"" sign.

Now, I will start to discuss the *hard truths*. I will discuss how enormous our budget shortfall is and how all the previous efforts, which I enumerate in detail, have not been enough to come even close to closing the gap.

As a result, surely now you will see that we have no other option than to do the following:

(1) Terminate all contract workers, non-tenure track faculty, and 65% of lower-level administrative staff. Fortunately, you will all qualify now for a special Coronavirus inspired extra unemployment bonus that, surely, will make this feel more like a glorious paid vacation if not winning the lottery. You can thank us later.

(2) As for fortunate few staff allowed to remain (I bet you'd like to know if you're in this category, but let's keep the mystery), their [paid] hours will be reduced to a minimum. However, we all know their actually working hours will remain the same, maybe increase because now that they are working at home every waking hour is a potential working hour - and someone has to do the work of the 65% we’re letting go.

(3) Thanks to all the tenure track faculty who are part of the Flailing University family. That’s why I know they will be more than glad to take on all the extra teaching needed  (since we have purged all the teaching faculty, adjuncts, university-funded postdocs, researchers, assistants, and technicians) all while revising their curriculums to be entirely online, including lab sciences. A 25% pay cut will no doubt serve as a terrific incentive to work harder and maybe be able to get back to the barely living wage we were paying before. We all know it really doesn’t work like that, but you’ll try, won’t you!

(4) All senior administration will be taking a 4.387% pay-cut.

I want to close here but talking about how incredibly stressful, painful, even traumatizing it was for us - the senior administration - to make these decisions. We have screamed, we have cried, we rent our garments, we have gone up to as much as three times a week with our $300/hour shrinks. You see us being on a high perch here, but we're the ones suffering the most - always ready to take one on the chin for FU.

I wish you all the best in this difficult time for everybody! We are all in this together!

I highlight the rubric sections of where I think they are performing at midsemester and at the end of semester. I even cut and paste my weekly notes I keep on each student and share it with them. For my clinicals, I sit down with each student at midterm and spend 20-30 minutes giving feedback and how to improve and talk about whats going well.  I do this at the end as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I cant please 100% of my students but when I get feedback that Im not helpful or Im too blunt or rude or mean or whatever, I want to try to see if theres something I can do to improve. I just still feel like my evaluations of the students aren&amp;#39;t as polished as the college would like and although I&amp;#39;ve asked for a sample, they havent provided me with the most helpful feedback either on how to improve my evals and feedback to the students.&lt;/p&gt;

This post isn't about my kids, and it's definitely not about COVID-19 or the quarantine. Lord knows I hear enough about the virus and the quarantine already, I can't write about it too. Instead, I'm coming here with something that's been on my mind a lot lately; something that's been weighing me down for a long time.

I will never get over the disappointment of failing to get a tenure track professor position.

I loved everything about working at a college. I loved teaching. I loved watching students gain confidence in speaking Spanish and learn acceptance for whatever accent they had. I loved holding office hours and students randomly popping in to say hi. I loved planning events and going to conferences. I loved telling people about my research, even if they thought it was obscure and boring. I loved going to the library and coming out with a pile of books almost too heavy to walk back to my office. I loved attending job talks and conference presentations and colloquiums where I learned about all sorts or random and unecessary topics. I loved having a cup of coffee with a colleague between classes. Ok, ok, there's one thing I didn't love: faculty meetings where people went on and on and on when what they were saying didn't even have to do with the question at hand.

I guess now that I'm writing it down I realize what I miss most of all is constantly learning something new. Whether it's from a conference talk or researching for an article, I miss learning new things all the time.


I do have a really good job now. I teach high school Spanish and I love where I work. I have amazing colleagues, amazing administration and I have taught some really great kids. I never thought I would be good at teaching in an urban high school, I didn't even like being in high school myself.

I recently asked Khan Academy, in their own forum, to explain their pedagogical perspective that caused them to reject the idea of putting in a reset button for unit tests, despite *hundreds of users* complaining about the extreme punishment that the lack of such an option puts on people for failure.

Today, the moderators complained that the thread was becoming too off topic, which was a lie.  They also accused a participant in the conversation of being uncivil, for asking that people check their spelling better, because she was having a hard time reading some of the comments due to poor spelling and punctuation.

When I disagreed that the discussion was *not* off topic (because the pedagogical perspective issue was directly related to the reset button issue, as mentioned in my initial post) and that the request for better communication was not uncivil, my post was deleted, I was banned (I assume, as I cannot log in anymore), and the thread was closed for discussion on the grounds that it wasn't a thoughtful discussion or criticism of KA.

&amp;#x200B;

As an educator and as a parent who would like to use KA for my children's own education, this concerns me deeply.  I will no longer recommend Khan Academy to my undergrad students, friends, family, and others.  I will not use Khan Academy for my own education.  I will not use Khan Academy for my children.  I sincerely believe that at this point, using or recommending Khan Academy will cause people to *hate learning*, because the site now includes features that *punish students very harshly* for failure, and KA staff have stated that this is a critical part of their pedagogy that they refuse to change.  This is *worse* than even the fairly poor U.S. education system, and as an educator, I am appalled that students are treated like this by a learning platform that claims to offer a world class education (and that was founded by a man who teaches that punishing failure is *incredibly bad* for learning).

I fully expect this post to be deleted fairly quickly.  It is clear that KA is not interested in *any* sort of critical feedback, and if the mods here are the same ones on their official forum, they will delete this as soon as they see it, and they will probably ban me from posting here as well.  A copy of this this will be posted to *all* relevant subreddits I can find, starting with r/Professors, so if you want to share this with friends (and I highly recommend you do, especially if you are an educator), please look there and use that link, as it is at least less likely to be removed.

And every day the deadline gets closer I get more panicked. It's turning into this huge black cloud or snowball or something. 

I already have around 40 pages of garbled notes and 10-20 pages of images, exercises, and pull-out boxes. And it's only supposed to be a small ""guidebook"" of about 150 pages. So I have some good progress already. It's just... it's not ""coming together."" How do I make it to the finish line of completing this textbook project? 

What can I do to get this book finished? What did you do to write your academic textbook or monograph? Please someone help me. Give me any academic writing advice. Even if the advice is ""just sit down and write the book, duh"" - I am sure I need to hear it!

I am thinking about:

* Hiring a ghost writer or editor to take my notes and lay it all out in some sensible way (rates are pretty reasonable on Fiverr, actually)
* Negotiating an extension with the publisher (they said they may not be physically printing anything, for a while, with coronavirus - would it even be worth my time to publish an academic e-book only textbook?) - is this feasible or is it way too irresponsible? Is it worth asking my editor or could it ruin our relationship? 
* Forgetting that I ever wanted to write a book and give up the project (not really but, seriously, I am getting there)
* Maybe I could use some adderall or cool drugs to make it happen? That's what most famous writers have done, anyway, right? /s

I'm certain that this is the actual problem, but until mastering biology happens, I'll just have to use my overly critically thinking mind to deal...

So I'm TT at a SLAC, starting year 3. I absolutely love my college; my students, my colleagues, and where it's located. I feel pretty set up here. However, the salary is NOT great, my husband's salary is NOT great (he's a middle school teacher) and housing is a problem because we're in a tourist destination, and we're super far from both family and a reliable airport. Watching others, it seems like it would be challenging to have a kid in our one-bedroom condo, away from family and needing to afford expensive childcare. 

So I applied to other positions and was a top choice at another school with a higher salary, lower cost of living, and much closer to family. Aaaaaaaand then the pandemic. The position was cut ""at least for this year"", with an option that it could come back and they would love to hire me. Great, I'm still not counting on it. 

My husband and I are both 34, know that we want (most likely) only one kid. I'm feeling increasingly ready, but several unknowns; the job market next year, the possibility of moving with an infant, feeling uneasy about moving institutions ""closer"" to the tenure clock, navigating possible maternity leave at a new institution that I haven't worked at long, etc. I'm not sure if I have a specific question, other than if anyone has negotiated this decision while actively looking at other institutions?

When we switched our course to virtual, I canceled several assignments. It really didn't change the weighting of each category... just less assignments. However, I now have a student who is sitting on the edge between grades who sent me a scathing email complaining that because the course was no longer out of 1000 points as I originally promised, therefore she had less opportunities to get herself over that hump. 

Now, I fully realize that she's grasping at straws. There's certainly some level of personal responsibility that is being ignored here. She missed a few assignments and didn't bother to make them up even when I offered that students could submit any makeup work from the course (even from before we went online) for 75% credit... she also didn't bother with a very easy extra credit opportunity I offered. She's basically justifying half-assing some things because she expected more opportunities to make it up.  

There was absolutely nothing ambiguous about my course or what was expected. I updated the LMS when we went virtual with every single assignment, rubric, and discussion post and I gave them an amended assignment sheet so she knew exactly which assignments were due and when. I didn't change anything from the day I gave them that so there's no reason for anyone to think more assignments were coming.

ghpd1g,2020-05-11T11:11:31Z,NA,Professors,"I would appreciate some advice from my fellow professors on how to address what currently bothers me the most in my job: students lack of respect for classroom etiquette and their flippant attitude. 
During my 6 years of being a TA/ instructor of record at an R1 school I rarely had to deal with this, which allowed me to be the fun/casual professor that I genuinely wanted to be. In my relatively new position at a SLAC, I’m constantly frustrated with what I can describe as flippant attitude/ lack of respect. Here are some examples:
1) No matter how many times I explain the lateness policy and email reminders about it, (my class door is only open for 10 minutes) there’s always this kid who shows up 25 minutes late, and once confronted, instead of being apologetic, they choose to be rude about it, which affects my mood for the rest of the class.
2) I wouldn’t mind students eating/ drinking, as long as they’re not making a lot of noise. And every time there’s this kid who’s making a ton of noise, slurping, chewing on ice, etc. I tried the no eating/drinking policy, and it wasn’t effective either because again every class there’s someone I have to remind about the eating/drinking policy.
3) A good number of students do not know emailing a professor isn’t the same as texting their buddy. They neither use my name nor theirs, and somehow manage to squeeze in 10 grammatical mistakes in two lines, which makes me have to read the email several times in order to make sense of it.
The list goes on and on, and it all got even worse after we switched to online classes. The worst part of it is that every single one of these incidents affects me to an excessive extent, and I cannot seem to restore a friendly/ casual relationship with my students anymore, as I always wanted. I never envisioned being a professor would entail having to deal with middle school student type of behavior. As much as I hate being an uptight individual, I feel like I constantly have to keep my guard up to deal with the next disruptive behavior.
I think at the end there’s nothing I can do about it, and it is what it is, but I certainly appreciate any tips! :)

Edit1) I figured it’s necessary to further clarify my 10 minute policy: The reason being on time is a big deal in my classes is because I always start my classes with group activities, pop quizzes, etc., and the instructions for all those activities are given within the first 10 minutes of each class. Students who arrive 20 minutes late have no chance of catching up, and cannot contribute anything to a group assignment; yet, they’d like to add their names to a group and receive credit for it.

3) A good number of students do not know emailing a professor isn’t the same as texting their buddy. They neither use my name nor theirs, and somehow manage to squeeze in 10 grammatical mistakes in two lines, which makes me have to read the email several times in order to make sense of it.
The list goes on and on, and it all got even worse after we switched to online classes. The worst part of it is that every single one of these incidents affects me to an excessive extent, and I cannot seem to restore a friendly/ casual relationship with my students anymore, as I always wanted. I never envisioned being a professor would entail having to deal with middle school student type of behavior. As much as I hate being an uptight individual, I feel like I constantly have to keep my guard up to deal with the next disruptive behavior.
I think at the end there’s nothing I can do about it, and it is what it is, but I certainly appreciate any tips! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit1) I figured it’s necessary to further clarify my 10 minute policy: The reason being on time is a big deal in my classes is because I always start my classes with group activities, pop quizzes, etc., and the instructions for all those activities are given within the first 10 minutes of each class. Students who arrive 20 minutes late have no chance of catching up, and cannot contribute anything to a group assignment; yet, they’d like to add their names to a group and receive credit for it. So I would respectfully remind them that they cannot take the quiz at this point. (But I do not necessarily ask them to leave the class)&lt;/p&gt;

ghcxnj,2020-05-10T20:17:01Z,NA,Professors,"Posting under a throwaway because I am not TT and reasons.

At my institution, we have been told that fully on campus classes will not be an option for fall semester. We can choose hybrid, allowing for face to face meetings sometimes under a variety of possible schema, OR we can choose fully online.

Caveats: if going fully online, normal class sizes would be increased by almost 50%. Extra grading, workload, prep? Doesn't matter, quit whining. (this is how we increase enrollment/funds). Also probably can't use online proctoring for exams, though there is no definite word on this (I personally don't like proctoring via webcam, and won't do it unless required). Learning will no doubt suffer, and more students per section means I get even less time to try to make (and grade) meaningful assessments. But - I get to stay off campus and minimize risks to my health, my family, students, and I don't have to police all of the safety guidelines that are currently in development.

If going fully hybrid, normal enrollment cap stands, but must go on campus at least for some meetings, but I could do most of the lessons and assignments online. The sense that I am getting from my department is that we should use F2F meetings to give exams so we can minimize cheating. In theory I like this option, but in practice I could foresee a multitude of problems - how to maintain distance in a class of 48 students, do I break up exams to do so? Then what about the integrity of the exams? What about enforcing the safety guidelines? Who's job is it to sanitize the classroom? These things have not yet been determined but are in the works. At best, it will be a logistics tightrope walk, at worst, I'll be a temperature checking, mask wearing enforcement babysitter. Learning onus is still more on the student, but the hope is that F2F exams will encourage more active participation at home, contact with me online, and less inclination to cheat on the lower stakes online assignments because they'll fail the in person exams if they don't know the material.

ggzlzj,2020-05-10T07:10:24Z,NA,Professors,"Hi everyone! I could really use some thoughts on a student situation I am dealing with. Sorry that this is long! Tldr at bottom. 

I teach a 300 level class that was fully online this semester even before the Covid transitions. My online final exam was May 5; the students had to take it sometime that day at their convenience. Before the exam I sent out multiple reminder emails, study guides, etc. (Like I had done for two previous tests during the semester). Other than those emails, the exam date was listed in the syllabus.  

The morning after the exam I noticed one student had not taken it. Since she had been doing very well in the class, I sent her an email asking if she was okay and why she did not take the exam. After 3 days I never heard from her so I went ahead and submitted my final grades. The student got a C- when she was on track to earn an A- if she had taken the final. 

Two hours after I submitted my grades she emails me to tell me that she missed the final because she had confused the dates and wanted to see if she could make it up. I told her no; I had already submitted my final grades and I reminded her the importance of reading all professor emails. 

She responds and tells me her grandfather died this week and that she has not received any emails from me ALL SEMESTER. She claims there is something wrong with her emails, sends me screenshots of her inbox not showing emails from me (although she could have just deleted them), and claims she is dealing with a similar situation in another class. 

If she’s telling the truth, it seems insane to me that a student could be taking a fully online class and not think it was odd to receive absolutely NO communication from the professor all semester. However, I do feel bad that her final grade was so low. 

Is she totally lying to me? Am I being a softie for feeling bad about this? In order to change her grade I would have to submit a form saying I made a mistake calculating it. What would you do?

TLDR: Good student misses final, doesn’t respond to emails, gets a C- in class, claims she never receives any emails (and grandfather died?). What to do?

Is it just me, or have we gone WAY TOO FAR, with academic accommodations? Don't get me wrong, I get why we need them and willing to work with students. But some of the requests I see on the letters of accommodations are outrageous and we are not setting them up for success at all in the real world. I’m in business and still work in the field. I prefer to be realistic, so if we were to apply some of these requests into the real world, HR would be laughing them out of the building, irrespective of whatever  “all candidates are invited to apply” mantra we want to project.

Biggest pet peeves:

* Vaguely worded letters of accommodations. 
* Free for all on deadlines. Student basically just gets to choose whether they need an extension or not (spoiler alert, most of the time they do indeed ""exercise"" this ""option"")
* Accommodations that fly directly in the face of learning goals and outcomes. Eg. “Please allow alternatives to classroom presentation if possible” ABSOLUTELY NOT. The whole premise of such course is to for students to develop these skills.  
* Putting all the work for accommodating onto the faculty, when the disability office job is literally to do this.

It seems to be a free for all for students to get whatever the heck they want.  I doubt the counselors even “verify” these requests nowadays. They just willfully accept whatever students tell them. Once fought to the death with the disability office over a student who tried to get out of an...INTERVIEW assignment.

I encourage students to contact me if they don't understand what a question is asking, and have done so all semester.

And yet I have a few students who leave questions blank (in one case, an entire third of the exam) and just writing ""IDK"" or ""I wasn't sure how to do this problem"". 

I can tell that not everyone in the class watches the YouTube videos based on the number of views. I'll have to look for the download stats for my PowerPoints, but my guess is that the ""IDK"" students haven't touched them. I certainly haven't gotten any questions from them.

gfwl8n,2020-05-08T12:42:54Z,NA,Professors,"#Introduction
Due to the unprecedented changes in social configurations as a consequence of biopolitical, neoliberal, and postcolonial knowledge/power structures always already operating over and against the inter-/subjectivity of particular bodies, we as professors are confronted with new pedagogical challenges daily. Not only are administrators synergizing budgets to meet interdisciplinary and cross-dimensional downstream revenue melt, new challenges have emerged due, at least in part, to the domesticization of teaching as such. Thus this paper asks a simple question: am I inflating grades because COVID-19? 

#Literature Review
An exhaustive review of the literature shows no prior research on the subject of my grade inflation due to the reification of social distancing in COVID-19. Several recent studies, however, have suggested that the practice is, to put it mildly, not good. Zarubin and Uldanov (2020) call it an ""'illness'"" (11). Gershenson (2020) reaches a similar conclusion: ""Inflated grades can lead to a sense of complacency that prevents students from reaching their full potential and prevent[s] parents from understanding what challenges their children face and holding them accountable for their performance."" (np) Such moralizing notwithstanding, no research has been conducted on this subject, and thus this study is worthy of publication in the Journal of Professor Studies. 

#Methodology
I graded things and then thought about how the averages compared to the past. 

#Data
Two visualization outcomes have been created to meet the digital humanities plank of the College's last strategic plan.

I am teaching a 200-level course required for majors, that is, shall we say, dreaded by many (and loved by few!).   This is my absolute favorite course to teach though I do empathize with students who don't feel strong in this field.  As a result, I'm lenient.  Very lenient.  Plus I'm a VAP so I need those sweet, sweet evals.  This student is a junior.  Seniors are not permitted to take this class.

This student was ill before the pandemic shut us down.  Her dean (at our university, each student as a ""dean"" who is basically their social worker) told me to be extra lenient with her.  Okay, sure, don't mind.  She missed the first paper.  It's a ""discussion paper.""  Tell me what you feel, I'll give you an A+, it'll make up for your exam grades.  ""Be lenient!"" they said.  ""I'll grade it whenever you get it to me!"" I said.

Post-extra-long-spring break, we have an exam.  I turn it into a take-home.  Day after it's due, this student says, ""natural disaster, I couldn't submit to the LMS."" I say whatever, email it to me.  She sends me nothing.  Two weeks later and other students are breathing down my neck to return exams, I tell her I haven't received hers and at this point she has a zero and will fail the class (she failed the first midterm and by this time hadn't turned in TWO papers).  No response.  I return exams.

Three days later, I receive a panicked email with a screenshot.  The screenshot shows her exam (or a file named as her exam, Last First Course# Exam.pdf).   Uploaded the day after the exam was due.  *Listed as graded*.  It was clearly the correct assignment page.  It was clearly labeled ""graded.""  I double-check the LMS.  No exam from her, especially nothing that I had unknowingly graded.  The screen shot is named for the date it was taken.  Being *lenient*, I tell her ""looks like you submitted but it didn't work!  Oopsy!  Email me **ASAP!""**  No response.  I move on with my life.

*Yesterday*.  Middle of finals week.  I receive an email at 3AM with, just, phenomenal responses to this exam. It has the same file name as her screenshot (which isn't surprising as I require specific formatting of file names).  I check the document properties, it was created 15 minutes before the email was sent.  I know that doesn't prove anything, but it doesn't disprove anything, it's just *interesting*.

Contact her dean.  Tell her it's fishy.  Dean says she's been in contact with this student and I should be *lenient*.  I'm befuddled because she's clearly messing with me.

I draft an email to this student.  In doing so, I make sure I'm correct that she hasn't turned in any papers this semester.  Lo and behold, there is a submission for the last paper, due last Riday!  Submitted EARLY! ...The day she sent me the screen shot!  With a file named Last First Course# Exam.pdf!  Okay, so she just submitted two weeks late and doctored a screen shot, at least she handed something in, right?

It's a .pdf of a journal article.

I have nothing to base my grade on except one failed exam and one clearly fraudulant exam.  Her dean says be *lenient*.  I talk to my boss, he says yeah she's messing with you, but if you report her for academic dishonesty you'll regret it.

About a week ago an email by a senior member of that faculty telling me that an instructor is retiring. She strongly suggested that I express my interest in teaching his classes. I was super excited about this. So, I emailed the chair of the department and expressed my interest, and I also emailed the Dean. The chair of my department is now also aware that I expressed interest in teaching in this department. So, I've been waiting around hoping to hear back, thinking that this is my chance to increase my permanent workload to 100% in an ideal situation - 50% in the department I currently work in and 50% in the other department. Fast forward to today, I get an email from the same person who suggested I apply. She asked if I have heard anything back and she suggested that if I don't hear anything back I should grieve it with the union. This sounded weird to me since it's pretty clear in our collective agreement that we don't have rights across departments, but rather than have that conversation through email, I asked her to call me to discuss it. We chatted and it turns out she thinks there might be some ambiguity in the language (almost always is). I probed some more and she revealed that 2 of the law classes have been promised to a new instructor who is,
objectively, far less qualified than me. I'm irritated and confused as to why the other prof suggested that I apply in the first place if she knows that those classes are gone. WTF??

gf2jj9,2020-05-07T04:15:56Z,NA,Professors,"Hi,

this is a question for profs in the **humanities** who have **designed as an online course** (not just COVID-19 emergency online teaching!)

My online course will be mostly asynch with recorded videos and reading material. 

I am still wondering **how many hours of videos I should do in total** to mirror the f2f teaching in terms of time requirements. 

In a f2f course, our students have **24 hours of lectures**, 6 hrs tutorials, and 100 self-study. 

But if I recorded videos worth 24 hours in total it would mean creating 240 (!) videos (assuming that each video is about 6 minutes long, as research suggests it should be). Even half of it, 120 videos, seems crazy to me. It also means writing 120 scripts, each about 1500 words. 

There's not a fixed amount of material I need to get through in my courses, so the advice ""however long it takes to get through the material"" doesn't help.

I've already asked the ID at our university and he can't help. The university doesn't really do online yet, so they don't have rules about it yet.

advice. Last year our small department (small private school) hired a new chair, and he has been horrible since the start. He micromanages everything my colleagues and I do. I have no say in my schedule, the courses I teach, and he even tried to make me change my textbook (before I gently reminded him of the academic freedom clause in the handbook). 

I solely teach out of college service classes now, against my will. He prevents me from buying supplies for research, and has even taken my club away from me, because for some reason he’d like to run it even through the students chose me as an advisor. 

I’m not sure what to do. We have an interim dean right now, all of my colleagues and I have filed several complaints with HR and the administration.

I've taught online classes for a few years, so I'm used to them, but my load was 4-5 f2f courses and 1 online one per semester. It's been tough teaching online only and not seeing the f2f students I got to know so well. In almost all of my classes we'd have good laughing bouts just about every class  this semester, well, once we got to know each other. Really good rapport. That's my favorite part of this job, so when I heard this leaked news, I was upset. I'm having a hard time functioning working from home without student interaction.

gerbep,2020-05-06T16:00:34Z,NA,Professors,"University and departmental administration have made it clear there will be no lowering of standards for student work during the terms we're teaching exclusively online.  I get that, and support it, but they've also declared they're not going to adopt the increased S/NC policies many Universities have turned to in acknowledgment of the students' (and our) bizarre situation.

That doesn't seem consistent to me.  It means we're holding students to a standard which assumes they've got all the benefits of a regular in-person term: instructor attention, instant feedback, classroom engagement, longer, more comprehensive lectures, office hours, etc.   If we accept the premise that online instruction (at least for those of us new to it) is not equivalent to the on-campus experience, then holding students to the same standard we'd demand for on-campus work is hypocritical, even immoral.

My solution: infinite retakes.

Every assignment, every homework, every midterm, even the final project, can be turned in, graded, then revised for full credit.  They can then revise it again, as many times as they need or want to, and get the highest grade each time.

  I'm not relaxing the standards for mastery of the course material.  If anything, this policy frees me up to be an absolute hardass with grading, since I know students can redo the work for a higher grade.  The final class grade will accurately represent the student's eventual mastery of the material.  This policy eliminates much of the unfair consequence of the unpredictable online home-learning environment many students are dealing with.  The system is arguably closer to real-world situations, in which we often can revise work until it's the way we want it before we set it aside as 'done'.  And there's even good evidence that this is a more effective way for students to learn, since they revisit and re-study material over the course of the term instead of cramming for a one-time test, then forgetting all they crammed.

geduq0,2020-05-06T01:12:59Z,NA,Professors,"Hi everyone!

I need some advice about a student who emailed me after I posted their final lab grades asking about an assignment they supposedly did.

Once we shifted online, we started doing virtual labs. On the first virtual lab, there was a genetics puzzle game and a Blackboard quiz. The quiz was available until the due date, then it became unavailable. Now I have not taught online before, so I wasn't aware that I had set the quiz to become unavailable after the due date. However, the instructions VERY clearly stated that there was a quiz they needed to turn in.

The student emailed me saying they had done the assignment, but got a zero for it.

I checked the grades. There were no attempts made on the quiz.

I checked the usage statistics. The student had never even accessed the quiz.

I checked the usage statistics for the link to the puzzle game. The student accessed the puzzle the day AFTER the due date for that week's lab activities.

This leads me to believe that they completed only the puzzle game and did not do the quiz because it was unavailable after the due date. However, the instructions VERY clearly stated they had to turn in a quiz. So why wouldn't the student have emailed me to ask where the quiz was?

Now the other part to this is that I set an absolute deadline for all make-up and late work for May 4th at 11:59PM. This is because my primary instructor asked me to send her my final grades by tomorrow, May 6th.

Now, after the deadline for late work, after the final lab exam, and after I posted and sent in my final grades, the student is asking about the missing lab grade.

I don't know if I should be lenient or hold fast. What do you think?

TL;DR After I posted final lab grades, a student claims they completed an assignment and received a zero. They never submitted that assignment, but appear to have done the puzzle activity based on usage statistics. They accessed the materials after that week's due date and did not ask me about the assignment until after the final late work deadline.

Edit: Thank you all for your advice! I calculated how much the assignment would play into their final course grade (which includes their lecture grades). It turns out it would not have changed their total grade more than one point in either direction.

I was in a committee in college as a student proxy (hope that’s the right words, not a native speaker. I was still a student and supposed to act on behalf of the student body in the committee) where we would also discuss severe cases of plagiarism. At colleges in Germany, you normally got a warning if you are caught plagiarizing the first time. After that, professors will look extra closely if you are plagiarizing again, and if you’re caught again, in severe cases you will get expelled. 


This one guy studied History, so that means lots of term papers, at least one per semester. The very first one was pulled off a famous website where you can buy term papers. He got caught, got his warning and failed the paper so he had to do it again. Passed on second try.


The guy continued his studies and eventually got to the point where you need to write a large paper to get your bachelor degree. The Professor reading this last paper thought it might be plagiarized and reported that. Only then did it come to notice that the student should be under closer watch for plagiarism, something that somehow got forgotten over the years he was studying. You see, as in History there are so many papers, not everything gets put through software. 


So they put ALL his papers through the plagiarism software. EVERYTHING was plagiarized, about 5 to 6 papers. From the documents we had in the committee, it was insanely obvious too. 

My favorite was the one where he wrote the first sentence of the introduction himself and after that he copy-pasted a whole paper from one of these websites.
