# Reddit Unthreading

This repo contains some initial work toward a project titled *Closing a semester during the COVID-19 pandemic: Higher education professionals seeking and sharing advice on instructional design strategies in Reddit*. I also hope to put these functions into an `R` package called **{redditor}** in the near future.

## Data Sharing

Full data for this project are publicly available through Open Science Framework (COMING SOON).
